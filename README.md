# SentimentAnalysis using NLP

The primary aim of this research is:
To explore and compare the performance and effectiveness of Naïve Bayes, VADER, and DistilBERT models in sentiment analysis.

Each model represents one of the popular approaches, ranging from traditional machine learning methods (Naïve Bayes) to lexicon-based (VADER) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (DistlBERT). Diverse datasets containing product reviews are used to evaluate each model’s accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation.

The objectives of this study are as follows:

1. Implementing Naïve Bayes, VADER, and DistilBERT models for sentiment analysis
2. Comparing the performance of these models on review dataset, considering factors such as accuracy, f1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
3. Analysing the strengths and limitations of each model in different scenarios and uses cases.

The dataset used in this research was selected based on its availability, accessibility, and licensing requirement. Mendeley was identified as a reliable source for such datasets. The dataset that was ultimately selected was the “Opinions dataset” from Mendeley[1] which consists of user reviews for devices from nine mobile brands namely, Lenovo, iPhone, Micromax, Vivo, Redmi, Panasonic, Motorola, Oppo, and Nokia. Combining the data resulted in a total of 161,192 records and 10 columns. Among these columns, only the review text and rating fields are considered, as the other feature columns add little value to this research. The analysis will be specifically done with the Lenovo subset which has 26,600 records.
