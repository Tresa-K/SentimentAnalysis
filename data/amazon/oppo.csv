  Smart buy in this price segment.
  
  Actually i was looking for nice looks bored with the gold color.  with good camera quality. Samsung C9 pro has nice looks but camera quality is very poor. Oppo f3 plus front camera is very good quality. Lets use for 7 day and i will give complete review

Abhishek Shaw,18af954444f54d5ea34f80a12767a49e,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,5,Just wow!,"First let me inform you about a very important thing to those buyers who are complaining that they haven't received the earphone, please check the box properly, the earphone is just below where the USB cable was kept.
  

  Now coming to the phone, which I purchased for just 10,800  (in 12 months zero cost EMI with my HDFC credit card) by exchanging my 1.5 years old Moto X style at 12,000 . Thanks flipkart and oppo for this great deal!
  

  This phone is definitely overpriced, and if it's priced between 15-20k then it's really a good buy!
  

  I'm using this phone since last 4 days, and here's positive and negative impressions:
  

  Camera: The rear 16mp camera is really great. It captures some great shots in daylight, indoor light and low light. You'll get great bokeh effect because of it's 1.7f aperture. The flash is bright too.
  

  The front 16mp selfie camera is one of the best I've ever seen. It captures great details and bright selfies at all lighting conditions. The 8mp wide angle lens is very wide for group selfies the quality is quite good. Though it lacks details and in low light it attracts noise. But I'm not impressed with it's bokeh mode. First, the bokeh mode works in beauty mode only which makes the photo artificial and second it's not able to differentiate properly between the subject and background. As a result you'll see your hair, shoulders are getting blurred. Oppo needs to update the camera app so that we can take the advantage of the dual selfie camera properly. So basically it's a phone with two front camera not dual camera.
  

  Build quality and design: The build quality is good because of metal body. Special thanks to oppo for providing good soft transparent cover and pre applied screen guard out of the box.
  

  Performance: The performance is really smooth because of SD652 and 4gb ram. I haven't find any hiccups while doing daily task of browsing, social networking, camera, gaming etc. I've also noticed that the os use very less RAM in comparison to with other phones. Take example of my Mi A1 where the total ram is 3.5gb and in this phone the total ram is around 3.8 gb. But one big flaw in this color os is the ram management. The os often freeze the apps which run in background like internet speed meter, Ad blocker etc. As a result I miss the notification of whatsapp, Facebook etc. I'm still trying to find a way to resolve this.
  

  Display: The corning gorilla glass 5 protected 6 inch is very bright and colourful. But it's highly saturated too. The display os on the warmer side and unfortunately you can't change the color temperature. Due to this the skin tone of people while watching videos looks red, yellow and pinkish.
  

  Sound: The sound quality is nice. Speaker volume is adequately loud. The real HD sound equalizer by oppo didn't excited me much. Dolby atmos and my Mi A1 sound output is much better. The earphone is decent, nothing special.
  

  Call: The call quality is good and the network reception is also fine with my Jio 4g.
  

  Finger print: The finger print sensor is one of the fastest. But personally I prefer finger print on rear side. Due to the size of the phone it's bit difficult to unlock it with your thumb everytime.
  

  OS and software: I didn't liked the color OS at all. It's really far behind MiUi. There's not much customization  option you'll get. Wish they improve it with update and hope I'll get nougat update.
  

  Battery: I'm yet to test the 4000mah battery properly, will add my feedback after a week or two. But I'm really impressed with the fast VOOC charging which is blazingly fast. It charges the phone from 15 to 90 in just an hour and fully charged the phone in approx 90 minutes.
  

  Overall I'm very much satisfied with my 10,800  spent on this selfie expert. I've never thought or planned that I'll ever use oppo smartphones, but seriously guys if you're getting such huge discount deals, and okay with some flaws which I've mentioned above  then go for it! I'm sure you'll not regret it.

Rajesh T G,5df2bedf1008490a9b9b31012ae9ebd8,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,3,Above-average product,"Good camera centric phone. Even lthough I am not happy with the pricing, the phone is a good performer in terms of camera, battery life, call  and data, media.
  

  The build quality of this phone is good and looks like a member of iPhone family. The full HD screen is vibrant and the colours appears to be over saturated. There is no option in the phone to set the colour balance. Viewing angles of the screen are great and also the outdoor visibility is good too.
  

  There is no lag in the phone's daily performance. Memory management implementation is good thanks to the 4 GB RAM. Call quality is loud and clear even with volte.
  

  Camera performance is good in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions but the OIS implementation is above average only. If you are not careful you will end up with shaky images.
  

  Battery life is okay and it can easily last for a full day with moderate usage.
  

  The phone is good for multimedia. Audio from headphone sounds great with real HD option turned on. It even sound better than Lenovo vibe X3.
  

  Now about the cons I observed in the phone. Many people especially those who have used Samsung or Nexus phone would not appreciate the experience of color os. The phone's price never justifies it's hardware. Offline models like vivo V5 plus (having almost similar specs) are sold for a much cheaper price. Future software updates are a big question mark. The phone launched in 2017 still run on the almost outdated marshmallow os.
  

  Overall it a good phone. I'll recommend this phone over Samsung Galaxy A and C series phone.

  Advantages:
  
  Screen display quality is awesome. Rich feeling.
  

  You can change display font by using third party app (ifont). But in f3 you don't have that option.
  

  Battery backup is good. Awesome fast charging.
  

  FAST finger print sensor. Working very nice.
  
  Camera picture quality is good.
  

  Color os operating system is really designed well. It gives rich feeling while using the phone.
  

  Third party launchers are working fine with this phone. (N launcher, nova launcher, etc).
  

  Notification settings are nice.
  

  Inbuilt app security lock is nice (finger print app lock and passcode lock)
  

  Battery backup in standby mode is awesome.
  

  Music player sound effect is good (maybe depends on headphone quality).
  

  Phone looks very good when handling and very slim.
  

  Disadvantages:
  

  Phone relased before more than six months but still running in marshmallow.
  

  Color os 3.2 released in oppo f5 but it still running in 3.0
  

  Phone is getting heat While using camera for more than 5 minutes.
  

  No NFC Connectivity in this highly priced  phone.
  

  Audio output is low in outdoors and indoors. Only hearable at night (while others sleeping)
  

  Gorilla glass 5 but I got a small scratch on my display even i maintained well. Don't know what is the use of Gorilla 5 glass.
  

  And its 2.5d curved display is irritating when the tempered glass is not fit in to the display. But without tempered glass phone looks awesome but i don't want to take risk.
  

  Conclusion:
  
  You can buy this phone if the manufacturer gives proper software updates regularly at least up to Oreo ( because of high price). Otherwise its a very very Awesome phone in the market..

  I am using this phone since 1 week and i liked it very much. I always used big brand products and i was thinking whether  to buy it or not but i like specification on paper a lot and with good exchange value i buy this phone.
  
  Now come to point
  
  1.Design it slim and superb looking phn jst like i phn i fall in love with this beuty after i saw it. P
  
  2.Processor is very fast doesnt heat even at high uses while charging also, power managment to good in this processor very good at long day uses.
  
  3.Screen it is large 6"" screen but phn size is nt uncomfortable it is easy to hold for boy atleast,  even though it is tft display it gives u very superior quality of visuals from any angle ppi is very good here for sharo images
  
  4.Camera now come to tag line for this phn sual selfie  camera so not to mention both camera has a good ability to capture good images. You dont need selfie stick any more with his wide angle secondry front camera,  to my suprice rear camera is too good at tgis price and they didnt even advertise about it belive me its better thn front camera and they didnt even mentioned it.
  
  5.Battery as per my thinking i was confused about 4000mah battery for large 6"" display and how long it wiil last but they manage it so well even  after heavy uses like surfing, downloading, wathching movies it last all day. I dindt play games so sorry dnt nw abt tht hw lng it wil last with heavy games.  But for decent user it far more than enough.
  
  6.charger if u ask me charger is best thing i like in this mobile it charge my phn upto 50% in just  30 minutes or less may be i liked it very much nw i dont need to carry power bank just beacause i forget to charge my phn. Now with this charger in very shrt time i will get day long charged phn loving it. Its vooc 4amp 5v charger.
  
  7.Os louncher- its colour Os it was little dificult for me to adjust to this os beacause i never had any chinese phn before but i liked this simple, fast and responsive doest take ram for unworthy stuff like animation widgets and blah blah blah.... It gives u what u need nothing unecessory adede to it keeps phn simple and lag free
  
  8.Music Chip-they didnt even tell us what they used vuts it best music i heard so far with this phn and its headphones its superb feels like uvr living in the musin mesmorising.
  
  So i dont see any flaws with this phn ya but price tag of 25000 makes you reconsider but you got nice exchange offer so it wil be good around 20,000 and to my notice its farrrrrrrr better thn vivo v7+ in every angle. So buy it.

  1) Camera Jus 10/10. I compared its camera wid all flagship..like I 7+, V7+, and One plus 5...but all got fail in every environment..
  

  2) Am a big multitasker but when it comes in phone all phone start showinn their lagging at some point.  but This i would say best in all because of its Ram and latest Processor.
  

  3) Battery is just aswesome now i forget when i last carry my power bank with me... because it has 4000 MaH battery with VOOC Charge that ...Charges my phone from 0-100% in jus 50 Minutes...

Amaresh Narayanan,d03bde3f46f74135adb3c83e75d23abf,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,4,Genuine review after 10 days use,"Overall Mobile is Good.
  

  1. Actually, this mobile is not worth for 25K (as shown in flipkart), but I bought this mobile for ~15K on exchange offer (25K - (8000 exchange off + 700 for my 5 years old Moto G mobile + 1600 HDFC card discount) = ~15K).
  
  2. The front camera is Very Good, frankly speaking, my face is oiled face, but the selfy comes like a fresh face. So, selfy lovers can go for this mobile. Quick focus and quick shoot.
  
  3. Back came is also good, but not like the front camera. Quick focus and quick shoot.
  
  4. Sometimes, I felt slowness (but not hanging) while normal operations. Not major
  
  5. The fingerprint is very slow, previously I was using ""LeEco Le 1S"", in that Fingerprint is very quick. but in Oppo F3 Plus, I have to hold and wait for .5 to 1 second. This is annoying everytime.
  
  6. 6inch screen is very big (previously I was using 5.5inch mobile), initially I felt very big, but its ok now (no other way. :-) ). We have to use both the hands for typing.
  

  If you are normal user (not Game player) and selfy lover, just go for it.

First of all thanks to flipkart  for the fabulous exchange offer... 6000 off and 8000 exchange bonus... Bought the phone for 12.5k on exchange of my 1.5 year old Samsung J7.
  

  PROS
  
  6 inch colourful screen is a pleasure to watch videos....
  
  5000 Mah battery  lasts up-to 2days on moderate  usage...
  
  Amazing picture quality especially  for front camera.... Back camera is good Too
  
  No difficulty  in migrating from my Samsung  (using since 2013) since both have a lot similarity
  
  Finger print ID is very agile and handy...
  
  Sound quality  is fine ...
  
  Even though  it is using the older generation Snapdragon 653  processor it not getting hang can navigate  easily  between apps...
  
  Build quality  is good...
  
  Dual sim and expandable memory are other plus points
  
  Feels like iPhone in certain aspects.
  
  Comes with free screen guard and back cover...
  
  CONS
  
  Could  have used the latest 835 Snapdragon
  
  Especially  when you consider that it's priced around 30 and competors  like one plus 3T are using latest Snapdragon....

  Final conclusion:- in my personal opinion I love screen awesome reproduction  of colours, fingerprint ultra fast, and I love rear camera than front both in day and night, front cam day performance awesome ,struggle slot in low light.

Just unbelievable  keep it up flipkart.  Product is best in this price.as for the phone every spec is good but I'll the screen on banking gateways is very sluggish. May be that is the reason why iPhone and Samsung are the leaders apart from that aspect I find nothing inferior  the highly price phone.  It is money you pay for their brands (highly paid managers, software engineers etc. ) I suggest opposite f3 plus moreover as modulo says make in India yes oppo!!!

Rajan Bhasin,5125b855e23d4d8ba446173292eab952,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,4,Best in class.,"This is the best phone in this class but not the best. Price is very high compare to its specifications. It was available for 24990 whent I bought this. Thanks to Flipkart sale. I got this one at 16000 approx under exchange and bank offer. I exchange Lenovo K3 note by which i got extra 5000 discount + phone value + 1500 bank discount. It is amazing experience for me.
  

  Now about the phone:-
  

  Best feature of this phone is its VOOC Charging technology. Phone can charge around 80% in 35 minutes.
  

  Secondly dual fromt camera which is amazing in day and night shots. It is specially designed for group selfies. Rear camera is also at satisfactory level.
  

  Processing speed is good as it comes with 1.96 ghz octa core processor with 4gb ram.
  

  The main issue i am facing is its software. It is still running on android marshmallow 6.0 whereas all other smartphones in this range are already powerd by android 7.1.1 and ready for android 8 too. I have gone through my research and find out that Oppo have no plans to release software update in coming months which is big disadvantage. Oppo is not good at all on software updates.
  

  Screen size is huge and cannot use single handed. I think it is more comfortable if it is 5.5. However, you can use it by one hand by compressing the screen. Resolution, screen colors are good and seems natural.

  Bad ones about the phone
  

  1) This phone still runs on Android M,  color os 3.0. With oppo f5 being already out,  not sure when or if this phone gets android N or O updates.
  

  2) Screen looks very saturated, everything looks darker in color than usual.
  

  3) This phone is  overpriced, you get same set of features in Xiaomi at 16k-17k. Processor could have been snapdragon 835 in order to justify this huge price.
  

  4) Color OS UI is still very much novice,  need a lot of improvements. It is least of all the UI's.
  



  Good ones about the phone.
  

  1) Phone size is huge also very sleek, looks premium at hands
  

  2) Cameras,   both rear and front gives you very detailed and awesome pics.  Better than average expectations.
  

  3) Comes with 4A fast charger,charges 10% in 5 mins, 90% in 1h 10 mins,  and 100% in 1.5 hours.
  

  4) Fingerprint sensor is quicker
  

  5) Comes with tempered glass applied and transparent silicon case, good quality earphones provided. You dont have to spill extra 1000 bucks for these.
  


  Verdict::
  

  If you are looking to flaunt your premium phone and a camera philic guy, without worrying too much on UI and software updates. Go for it.

Due to the screen size and battery it feels a little gracious otherwise a super phone at this price point.

Himanshu,5c969217c917492ea09769a3a588e5a0,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,5,Wonderful,"This is not an average phone but it is much bigger than than a 5.5 inch one. However, the screen to body ratio is 75% and above and hence a large portion of the front face is covered with screen. The weight is also good at 185gms.  the battery life is really good and for me lasts more than a day with routine use and minor gaming. I do not use 3g or 4g on the phone as the SIM card is ordinary 2g one. Inuse WiFi on it almost full day. A transparent silicon cover  is provided in the box. It fits vey snugly and looks good too. No to some pros and cons
  

  Pros
  
  Great screen. Display is crisp and vibrant. It also has blue light filter option. Touchscreen is good and responsive. Doesn't feel flimsy and overall phone build is awesome.
  
  Battery life is really good. Vooc charging is awesome.
  
  Down firing speaker is quite loud to make phone calls and for music or movies
  
  Weight and form factor is really good.
  
  Cameras are good too. But I did not find them truly awesome. Also, I don't do a lot of photography with mobile
  
  Provided head phones are good. They produce decent sound for voice and music
  

  Cons
  
  Charging with ordinary charger is slow. Vooc charger is big in size. So carrying it might not be possible for all
  
  All rocker buttons should have been on one side of the phone. That is volume key should be above power key. It's difficult to use volume keys. Also, the software for volume should provide a slider to adjust volume for phone, music, alarm etc...no such slider provided
  
  The touch buttons at bottom of screen bleed white light, so it looks kind of cheap.
  

  Overall a great phone. Flipkart provided fantastic exchange offer. The person who came for delivery was patient and polite and worked through the exchange process calmly with us. Thank you Flipkart for that.
  

  Ps: I knew before purchasing that the phone might not get latest android updates. I do miss features that are provided in android 7, but this is an informed decision I took. So not taking away credit from the phone itself

  Packing  of phone  is good.
  
  Phone,  Box,  charger,  handsfree all are brand new and well packed.
  
  I god 12k discount  on exchange of my lenovo k5 note.
  
  Now come to the phone...
  
  Front camera is awesome and back camera is also camera : very good  only one thing in camera is there is no flash on front  camera. 10/10
  


  Battery : battry backup and charging  is very good.  Charge 70% in less then 30min.
  
  After full charge  stay 1 full day of use (including  play online  game,  movie,  YouTube and downlow)
  
  I m maximum  playing online game.  In past if i played game for 2 hours battery gone more thn 50% bt now with  this phone after 3 hours of continues  playing game and 1hour watching  online video it consumes only 35%.
  
  No heating  while playing game which was terrible  in my lenovo k5.  10/10
  

  Performance  : its good and fast everything  done just by ur touch.  10/10
  

  Looking : awesome  bt now a days all r using back cover and tuffen so dosnt matter.  10/9
  

  Display : its good and bright also there is eye protection  option. 10/9
  

  Desige : it slim and not so big to carry in pocket bt not easy  to use  by one hand.
  
  10/9
  

  Price : in regular  price its too high compared to other phone  bt if u got it around  20k its a best deal
  

  If u r thinking  to buy it i suggest u to definitely  buy bt if u got good deal on it.

But I was damm frustated and wanted refund as i took this phone for selfies. But could only apply for exchange. Meanwhile i did the factory reset on advice of flipkart technical expert. And to my amaze all defects were removed. The selfies turned out too nice ie beyound my expectation. The SD 652 is ultra fast and fast charging a gem in itself. Finally satisfed with my phone and too happy. There is no front flash but u dont need it either with OF3+ until u wish to take selfies in complete darkness. If u get a perfect operational phone than think no beyound in this price range for class leading camera experience and blazing fast performance.

  Exchanged my OnePlus One, Which was an excellent phone.. Never had any issues over the past three years..  but no regrets.. This seems to be an awesome phone as well.. Got this one for a reasonable price of Rs12590 after exchange and also with a good buy back deal from flipkart.
  

  Would have been 5 stars if the phone comes with Android N.. Atleast hoping oppo will update the software until then 4 stars for oppo f3 plus

  This is the best android mobile. I have used past one week. See my comments below:
  

  1. Camera - 9/10
  
  2. Battery backup - 8.5/10
  
  3. Speed & Performance - 9/10
  
  4. Display - 9.5/10
  
  5. Marshmallow 6.0.1 is very good performance.
  
  6.  OPPO need to work on its software.
  
  7.It doesn't support JIO video calling...may be OPPO need to work on it.
  

  Overall is good and one negative thing is its COLOR OS.
  

  Finally I would like to say THANK YOU SO MUCH Flipkart and team members...

  Super fast delivery of Flipkart.
  
  This is a true selfie camera phone, the quality of photos is amazing, even better than Iphone 5s.
  
  The second best feature is its color os best on android. I am an iOS person but this os amazed me with its ease and its pretty simple to operate.
  
  Screen resolution quality and battery backup is amazing.
  
  Another small but important aspect I noticed that it comes with screen guard protector and a transparent case, very thoughtful, you dont need to worry about properly pasting a hard glass screen protector and its quality.
  
  I use this as my 2nd phone as primarily I use iPhone but this has impressed me a lot and its far better than the moto phones.

  Pros:
  
  Excellent Camera (both primary & secondary)
  
  Excellent Battery backup
  
  Huge Screen (not for people looking for small size)
  

  Cons:
  
  Android ver 6 (no information on latest updates)
  
  Individual App permissions for data network
  

  More positives than negatives. Go for it (only if getting around 15K).

Kalesh Menon,fbd716d9c5eb452abdb1afa1102d44c2,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,4,Very Good,"The selection of this phone was purely coincidental but I'm glad this happened. I was sort of looking for a replacement for my one plus x because it kept running out of space and was struggling with my use for power.
  

  The sale at Flipkart bought me a good deal on this phone. Though technically I should have gone for the one plus 3t due to obvious reason but the deal tilted the scales in favor of this one.
  

  Every aspect of this phone is top notch. The only glitch I feel is the Android version and the pricing. I hope the Android version will be upgraded soon and I hope OPPO doesn't decide to sell this phone at super discounts in the next few months. I also wished the screen was quad HD.
  

  Color OS is good but peculiar and you have to put efforts liking it. Eventually you might get there because it is not at all bad.
  

  The build quality is very good and so is the battery life. I hope the processor is good for couple of years and OPPO works on the Android update. The phone is very comfortable to hold but smaller hands might struggle.
  

  They copied everything from iPhone but didn't bother to include the hardware DND button. Even the one plus family has one now so this could have been included.
  

  I might not recommend buying this since the price can offer more popular options but I can very well say that you won't regret buying it either.

Manikandan Subramaniam,22d6fff622be48299cb363286e5976fc,"OPPO F3 Plus (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBES9G5SJHYT9QX,3,Just okay,"CONS:
  
  1. Sound Quality is below Average even when compare to Asus Zenfone 2.
  
  2. The Camera functions are not much user Manageable - All are default Menu Driven.
  
  3. The Latest Color OS (UI) is below Average - Personal Customisation not at all Possible (I wish to include Wifi Hotspot in Notifcation slider. But not possible).
  
  4. No Android / OS Update for a model Launched just Six Months Back with Old Android Version (Marshmallow)
  
  5.  No App drawer (Even Huawei included this faclity in latest UI)
  
  6. No Double Tap to Sleep option as in Asus (to Avoid prolonged use of Power Button). Only Double tap to Wake is there which is not much useful since it has Front FP Scanner
  
  7. No Dual App support.
  

  GOOD THINGS (Not Pros)
  
  1. Basis Mobile Functions are good
  
  2. No Heating even on Fast charging  (provided for this mobile).
  
  3. Both Cameras good but no Major customisation.
  

  The Pricing is too much for the above specs (only worth for Rs.12k.
  

  Oppo should provide atleast Nougat update for the money they robbed from us for this mobile.

  Don't buy this phone it's just a toy lot of features of Android are not there.They are making fool of us by giving extra off on exchange of your old mobile believe me any old working phone is better then this. However you can use it as a basic camera only. It's not a even 2000 rs phone. Lots of fake review are there I bought on the basis of those reviews,  don't believe on these fake reviews. colour and screen of its  is like 1000 rs Chinese phone. Very very poor display.

Oppo and vivo generally produce their smartphones with poor mediatek chipsets but this one is with Qualcom processor. Camera quality is really good as compared to Samsung A9 pro or C9 pro. Call ringtone is loud enough. Call signals are strong enough. Conversations are clear during call. Build quality is superb. Price is on the higher side. Should be between 20 to 25k. Black colour is awesome. Quality of screen guard applied on phone from factory side is not good and prone to scratches easily. One can go for it as Oppo did a good job in camera, basic telephony, build quality, sleekness of phone, looks premium. VOOC CHARGER is superb.

  Device is far better then others I had used earlier. and my experience with this from last 13-14 days is awesome.
  
  A must buy piece from Oppo.
  
  So here are some feedback for Oppo F3 Plus
  

  Pros:
  
  Powerful Selfie camera
  
  Color OS with  nice features and having feel of iOS foe few of it's functionality
  
  Touch is good
  
  Body structure Strong
  
  Thanks for Pre-Installed Screen Guard - good quality
  
  Special Thanks for Nice Earphones  - good quality
  
  Also the Transparent back cover  - good quality
  
  No heating Issue
  
  Battery performance is up to the mark one one time charge need in 1 and half day with few calls and full day data use
  
  and out of all I got it in best price for my Leveno K3 note Exchange and other offer by flipkart and HDFC
  

  Cons
  
  Few features missing in OS ( Must have some profile management for different hours of working, lunch and home Mobile Ring mode settings)
  
  Sound quality can be more better ( it is good right now)
  


  ---------------------------------------------------
  
  Overall awesome deal
  

  Thanks :)

  With a 6 days of use im writing this review.
  
  I preordered this device on 9th may and on 13th [its release day] i hot the mobile.
  
  But they didnt give bahubali case when i contact them they have given 150/- wallet.but i got selfie stick which is nice.
  

  Pros:
  
  1] 16 + 8 mp camera. Exellent . [GIF, ULTRA HD, EXPERT MODE]  
  
  2] back camera 13mp is very nice and no shutter lag. [GIF, ULTRA HD, EXPERT MODE]
  
  3] 5.5FHD display.
  
  4] Super fast finger print scanner. [0.2seconds]
  
  5] 51.5GB usable ROM
  
  6] Full charging within 2 hours.
  
  7] 12 hours battery back up for heavy user. If we dont use Net it has last for 1 & 1/2 day.
  
  8] VOLTE support with clear voice.
  
  9] super autobrightness screen and eye protection also.
  
  10] light weight and slim model easy to handle.
  

  Cons.
  
  1] Video options are not there like slow motion . Only 720p and 1080p for both cameras.
  
  2] while charging phone heating observed.
  
  3] in 4GB RAM it is showing only 1.95GB RAM available .
  
  4] Little bit over priced. It would have the price 16k.
  
  .
  
  Conclusion:
  
  If ur a camera / photo lover buy this phone without any hesitation.

Camera on clicking took few min to open & was black out during the time & video was not showing the timer, unable to shoot & access. Later reported to flipkart, advised us to reset. But camera problem occured again aftr 3 days. Took few min to open & black out during the time & video also took time but the timer was showing this time. This time i video tape that issue in another phone. As i dont want to do reset again & again to make this new phone spending 20000/-, reported again to flipkart about the issue & asked for replacement. They started their protocols. Even aftr technicians visit, saw the problem in video tape, accept its geniune but because it didnt occur at that particular time he wrote the report problem resolved instead of problem didnt occured that time . So flipkart got away wid the excuses for replacement.
  
  Flipkart you are making an bad impression in my mind regarding the defective product replacement, which i video tape. Making me to go CONSUMER FORUM as i having geniuene problem withe proof.

This phone is good for those who love taking selfies and photos on the go. Using on ideal basis, the phone performs decent without any issues. The picture quality of the camera is in great. One of the best feature of front camera is that it has a wide view mode which covers at-least 50 more area than  normal camera. On a normal use basis, the battery gives 1 day backup. I have not checked for gaming performance since I am not a big fan of gaming activity. The color OS is not so great but you will get used to it once you starting using. Below is the Cons and Pros for the product:
  

  Cons:
  
  -Not an AMOLED display
  
  -Color OS not so impressive
  
  -Battery backup just for a day
  



  Pros:
  
  -Wide view front Camera
  
  -Impressive Beauty mode camera
  
  -64 GB in built memory with 4 GB of RAM
  
  -Dedicated slot each for 2 Sims and 1 memory card
  
  -Fast fingerprint response
  
  -Great external speaker quality, doesn't distort when on high volume.
  
  -Transparent back-cover and screengaurd, ejector pin & earphone included.

  Overall it is good but lacks in battery capacity because price range is higher if compared the same features in other brands like Mi which has good build quality with less price. Opportunity spends a lot of money of advertisment by celebrities therefore they will have to keep the price a little higher claiming that their product is best. But ideally either price should be a little lower or improve the build quality and battery capacity because phones are good but they are very delicate.

I am very happy with flipkart exchange offer. Very quickly delivered by FK. I have some issue with the mobile. Then I claimed for the replacement. Flipkart accepted my request and gave me another OPPO F3. I would like to share my experience with my OPPO F3 after 3months,
  
  Pros: 1.Great selfie camera and good rear camera
  
  2. Fast finger print scanner
  
  3.Fast charging and long lasting battery backup are very good
  
  4. Very nice phone on this price range we can go for.
  
  5.No heating issues even after long time game plays of heavy games
  

  Cons:
  
  1. Photos taken on low light is not up to the mark, very blur photos even the selfie cam.
  
  2. Overall performance is good, but the available RAM is only 2.1 GB on starting the mobile. In most of the cases available RAM is only 1.5GB even there is no background apps are running. This is the only backlog with this mobile. Even my friend's 3GB ram mobile has its 2.3 gb available ram on start.

Rakesh Hegde,327540aa39c24053908b64adf3001f00,"OPPO F1s (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBEZPTPVGSHCAHN,4,Delightful,"Pros :
  
  1- Awesome camera. One of the best
  
  2- 64gb memory with 128 expandable. Commendable at this price
  
  3- 4gb ram and octa core processor makes the experience smooth and lightening fast. I ran 21 apps simultaeneously and still no lag..so you can imagine
  
  4- Speaker at bottom instead of back side which makes the playback very loud and clear
  
  5- No matter how much load i put on it, no heating at all.
  
  6- Battery quite good.
  
  7- Network reception above par.
  
  8- Gorilla glass. Also screen clarity is quite good for a non full HD phone.
  

  Cons:
  
  1- Even though Cool OS UI is good, I shifted MiUi and feel quite restricted with customization and features. Hope frequent updates will be coming and improve the features.
  
  2- Pixel density 267 ppi which shows as some backgrounds are a bit granulated if you compare it with 440+ ppi screens of samsung or  Mi phones. But still not that noticeable to casual eyes.

  Pros:
  
  1. Superb camera both rear and front.
  
  2. Superb display.
  
  3. Seperate sim tray for dual sim and microsd card.
  
  4. Nice finish metallic body.
  
  5. Phone includes a back cover and headphones.
  

  Only cons I found is looking at the phone display size, battery could be much better if it could be around 4000 to 5000 mAh.

  Hanging problem
  
  Heating issue.
  
  Its heats in just 20min of watching youtube with wifi tethring on mode, then it's like i m using an microwave oven.
  
  And also bad service of flipkart.
  
  Now they give replacement not refund.
  
  And in replacement process
  
  Flipkart send technician and he said me this is not a problem he suggest me some points -
  
  1 I don't use any type of protection cover (Either Back cover or Flip cover) , this causes heating
  
  2 don't use internet and don't play game, this causes heating.
  
  3. And the most heroic suggestion that ""the phone is still alive it doesn't blast, when it blast then you come""
  
  But if i purchase a mobile worth 18k + pricing and i m facing heating problem of 49 to 51 degree,
  
  And just bcz of cover and playing game or surfing internet is a major problem then why i should go for 18k price
  
  Then i must buy 6k price phone.
  

  And now flipkart refuse to refund.
  
  So its monopoly of flipkart and they sell these type of faulty piece to customer to just improve their sells.
  
  They don't need now old customer.
  

  This is very bad experience with flipkart .
  
  I m suffering this phone. And service centers are also not replyed satiafactory answer
  
  So my suggestion is don't ever buy from flipkart
  
  Dont buy any product from flipkart they are very rude and full business man they dont need customer they just want to sell bad product like this.

  1. great camera quality
  
  2. great sound quality (better then every android device except htc 10 means compete to iphone)
  
  3. great display quality
  
  4. good performance
  

  cons:
  

  1. battery backup is unexpected
  
  2. 5.5 inch display is bakwaas, display size decreases to 5 inch or 5.2 inch
  
  3. heating issue
  

  anyway it's great phone in this price range so in my opinion it deserves 4 star

Both back and rear camera are amazing.  It's has a good Battery life, I use it whole day with single charge in the morning and thoughtout usage of internet and all my app.
  
  Ear phone is worst for takeing calls (voice becomes low with full volume of phone) ,  it's good only for music. Suggest u to take a better earphone.
  
  I m using this phone since 4months, sometime it's started hanging, screen turns completely blank. I have to then restart it back.
  
  Rather then this issue, I don't find any other reason of not buying this phone.
  

  Rest all is amazing!!! Worth for money...

I have done biggest mistake of my life by spending 17k in buying this phone. You can any other phone in just 12k with configuration better than this phone. Guys oppo is fooling by saying camera phone. It's camera is just normal as other 5 or 8 MP camera. This phone has 2 Years old OS(Android 5.1) , and I don't think so there will be any updates near future. It hangs a lot even though with 4 GB ram. To Wake up your phone you need to press the button to read your finger print. This phone doesn't work properly with my fitness smart band. Finally DO NOT BUY PLEASE

  Pros:
  
  Excellent built quality
  
  Good cameras with lots of features specially manual
  
  Good battery life
  
  Good audio quality
  
  Very responsive finger print scanner
  
  Cons:
  
  Screen quality isn't that great
  
  Average performance
  
  Screen bezels can be more narrow
  
  OS is outdated
  
  No guarantees  for updates as well
  

  It's a nice looking phone for selfies, buy in my opinion Moto M, Moto G5 plus  and sony Xperia A1 are smarter choices.

  1. Good looks.
  
  2. Device is lightweight.
  
  3.Screenguard and Silicone case were included.
  
  4. Simple UI. Basically a replica of iOS.
  
  5. Very responsive mostly due to 4GB RAM.
  

  No major cons noticed till now. Although display is only 1024X880p still it seems seamless and nice.
  

  Overall a good buy under 10k.

Prabhav Maheshwari,1c3f802441f14014a02ef08bec222f5d,"OPPO F1s (Gold, 64 GB)",MOBEZPTPVGSHCAHN,4,Good quality product,"Reviewing after 2 months of usage:
  
  Pros
  
  1. Looks superb
  
  2. Sim tray with 2 nano sim slot+ sd card slot....best about this phone
  
  3. Screen is undoubtedly good
  
  4. Fingerprint scanner works superb
  
  5. No hanging whatsoever
  
  6. Battery backup is good for a 3075 mAh battery...works full day with a single charge
  
  7. Camera. Needless to say about it. Oppo first sells it camera than the phone. Front (16MP) is beter than rear(13MP)
  

  Cons
  
  1. Android 5.1.... For a price this range OS could have been upgraded
  
  2. User interface....its very basic, little or no customisation at all.
  
  3. Color OS.....nothing but copy of iOS....till looks it is okay to copy apple....but OS also
  
  4.  Led notification light is just a waste of space. Doesnt turn on while charging...and notifications also only half the time

Camera quality is the best part  in this mobile. Display touch, fingerprint sensor and feather touch are fabulous and super  quick responsive. Battery capacity also less when compare to other mobiles in this price,  but it perfectly takes you a day of normal use of mobile. It doesn't comes with android 6.0, but they tried for Color-Os which is nice and easy to handle.
  
  Here are some pros and cons i suggest after i using it for 10 days,
  
  Pros:
  
  1. Good Build quality
  
  2. Good Camera quality both front and rear
  
  3. Super responsive fingerprint sensor
  
  4. Loud Speaker is so good
  
  5. Color-OS is very nice
  
  6. Supports VOLTE and OTG
  
  Cons:
  
  1. Price
  
  2. Battery only 3075mAh
  
  3. Android 5.1
  

  If you want to buy this mobile please wait for an offer otherwise go with lenovo k5 note or redmi note 4 which are giving medium camera quality

I know in u tube u will find a log of negatives about oppo phones and honestly m not a big phone either but I bought it for my wife and the kind of user she is,  this phone is excellent for her in this price segment. Mediated processor is quite old now but with 4gb ram and 64gb memory it ain't causing that problem. It's as good as snapdragon 430.

  1) smart look screen
  
  2) selfi camera is good but not more then samsung j7. J7 camera quality is far better then this
  

  Cons:
  
  1) Does not have new android system so new games and new applications does not working properly in thus phone
  
  2) Battery problems are common in this phone
  
  I have complained of it for twice but it seems the same
  
  3) full charged battery last longer for only 1 day
  
  4) does not have that much new features as compare to MI note 4. Even processor is very slow so that it runs very slow and hang problems while playing high resolution games
  
  5) does not support fluently VR mode
  
  5) expensive compare to MI note 4 Samsung j7prime Lenovo vibe k5 and they r far better then this dabba phone
  
  6) go for MI note 4 or samsung or Even lenovo is better then this
  

  Overall this phone does not deserve this much price and not even updated with latest android version please go for different phone

But at this price category they are providing very cheap specifications like old mediatek processor, 720p resolution screen with 221pi (with TFT display :( ) etc. Mostly processor and screen will decide the mobile price. Phone is too expensive with this features. Definitely it is not value for money phone.
  


  Just for camera sake you can buy this phone (with cheap phone specifications)

  3 star only for the camera and software version
  
  1.Cameras good but only for day time photography front camera  gives good pics then  back camera 
  
  But for night photography both are useless
  
  2. Android 5 which is already an outdated version still in this phone and don't know when this phone get upadets .
  
  3. Battery almost 3k mah not bad doesn't support fast charging but still charge faster with given charger.
  
  4. 4gbRAM and processor combined gives flawless performance.

Even in high end phones like F1s they are still using Android 5.1 (Lollipop). On contacting Oppo they say that an upgrade to Marshmallow will be rolled out soon but they have not decided a specific date and time (this was before 3 months and there is still no sign of update).
  

  Only massive hardware doesn't serve the purpose. A good and latest software is required to keep up with the hardware....

  Pros:
  
  1. Superb camera both rear and front.
  
  2. Superb display.
  
  3. Seperate sim tray for dual sim and microsd card.
  
  4. Nice finish metallic body.
  
  5. Phone includes a back cover and headphones.
  

  Only cons I found is looking at the phone display size, battery could be much better if it could be around 4000 to 5000 mAh.

  Hanging problem
  
  Heating issue.
  
  Its heats in just 20min of watching youtube with wifi tethring on mode, then it's like i m using an microwave oven.
  
  And also bad service of flipkart.
  
  Now they give replacement not refund.
  
  And in replacement process
  
  Flipkart send technician and he said me this is not a problem he suggest me some points -
  
  1 I don't use any type of protection cover (Either Back cover or Flip cover) , this causes heating
  
  2 don't use internet and don't play game, this causes heating.
  
  3. And the most heroic suggestion that ""the phone is still alive it doesn't blast, when it blast then you come""
  
  But if i purchase a mobile worth 18k + pricing and i m facing heating problem of 49 to 51 degree,
  
  And just bcz of cover and playing game or surfing internet is a major problem then why i should go for 18k price
  
  Then i must buy 6k price phone.
  

  And now flipkart refuse to refund.
  
  So its monopoly of flipkart and they sell these type of faulty piece to customer to just improve their sells.
  
  They don't need now old customer.
  

  This is very bad experience with flipkart .
  
  I m suffering this phone. And service centers are also not replyed satiafactory answer
  
  So my suggestion is don't ever buy from flipkart
  
  Dont buy any product from flipkart they are very rude and full business man they dont need customer they just want to sell bad product like this.

  cons:
  

  1. battery backup is unexpected
  
  2. 5.5 inch display is bakwaas, display size decreases to 5 inch or 5.2 inch

I have done biggest mistake of my life by spending 17k in buying this phone. You can any other phone in just 12k with configuration better than this phone. Guys oppo is fooling by saying camera phone. It's camera is just normal as other 5 or 8 MP camera. This phone has 2 Years old OS(Android 5.1) , and I don't think so there will be any updates near future. It hangs a lot even though with 4 GB ram. To Wake up your phone you need to press the button to read your finger print. This phone doesn't work properly with my fitness smart band. Finally DO NOT BUY PLEASE

  Pros:
  
  Excellent built quality
  
  Good cameras with lots of features specially manual
  
  Good battery life
  
  Good audio quality
  
  Very responsive finger print scanner
  
  Cons:
  
  Screen quality isn't that great
  
  Average performance
  
  Screen bezels can be more narrow
  
  OS is outdated
  
  No guarantees  for updates as well
  

  It's a nice looking phone for selfies, buy in my opinion Moto M, Moto G5 plus  and sony Xperia A1 are smarter choices.

  Pros
  
  1. Good looks.
  
  2. Device is lightweight.
  
  3.Screenguard and Silicone case were included.
  
  4. Simple UI. Basically a replica of iOS.
  
  5. Very responsive mostly due to 4GB RAM.
  

  No major cons noticed till now. Although display is only 1024X880p still it seems seamless and nice.
  

  Overall a good buy under 10k.

Prabhav Maheshwari,1c3f802441f14014a02ef08bec222f5d,"OPPO F1s (Grey, 64 GB)",MOBEPYQB7EAKZZRT,4,Good quality product,"Reviewing after 2 months of usage:
  
  Pros
  
  1. Looks superb
  
  2. Sim tray with 2 nano sim slot+ sd card slot....best about this phone
  
  3. Screen is undoubtedly good
  
  4. Fingerprint scanner works superb
  
  5. No hanging whatsoever
  
  6. Battery backup is good for a 3075 mAh battery...works full day with a single charge
  
  7. Camera. Needless to say about it. Oppo first sells it camera than the phone. Front (16MP) is beter than rear(13MP)
  

  Cons
  
  1. Android 5.1.... For a price this range OS could have been upgraded
  
  2. User interface....its very basic, little or no customisation at all.
  
  3. Color OS.....nothing but copy of iOS....till looks it is okay to copy apple....but OS also
  
  4.  Led notification light is just a waste of space. Doesnt turn on while charging...and notifications also only half the time

Rakesh Hegde,327540aa39c24053908b64adf3001f00,"OPPO F1s (Rose Gold, 64 GB)",MOBEQCQVGHRKYZEZ,4,Delightful,"Pros :
  
  1- Awesome camera. One of the best
  
  2- 64gb memory with 128 expandable. Commendable at this price
  
  3- 4gb ram and octa core processor makes the experience smooth and lightening fast. I ran 21 apps simultaeneously and still no lag..so you can imagine
  
  4- Speaker at bottom instead of back side which makes the playback very loud and clear
  
  5- No matter how much load i put on it, no heating at all.
  
  6- Battery quite good.
  
  7- Network reception above par.
  
  8- Gorilla glass. Also screen clarity is quite good for a non full HD phone.
  

  Cons:
  
  1- Even though Cool OS UI is good, I shifted MiUi and feel quite restricted with customization and features. Hope frequent updates will be coming and improve the features.
  
  2- Pixel density 267 ppi which shows as some backgrounds are a bit granulated if you compare it with 440+ ppi screens of samsung or  Mi phones. But still not that noticeable to casual eyes.

  3. Seperate sim tray for dual sim and microsd card.
  
  4. Nice finish metallic body.
  
  5. Phone includes a back cover and headphones.
  

  Only cons I found is looking at the phone display size, battery could be much better if it could be around 4000 to 5000 mAh.

  Hanging problem
  
  Heating issue.
  
  Its heats in just 20min of watching youtube with wifi tethring on mode, then it's like i m using an microwave oven.
  
  And also bad service of flipkart.
  
  Now they give replacement not refund.
  
  And in replacement process
  
  Flipkart send technician and he said me this is not a problem he suggest me some points -
  
  1 I don't use any type of protection cover (Either Back cover or Flip cover) , this causes heating
  
  2 don't use internet and don't play game, this causes heating.
  
  3. And the most heroic suggestion that ""the phone is still alive it doesn't blast, when it blast then you come""
  
  But if i purchase a mobile worth 18k + pricing and i m facing heating problem of 49 to 51 degree,
  
  And just bcz of cover and playing game or surfing internet is a major problem then why i should go for 18k price
  
  Then i must buy 6k price phone.
  

  And now flipkart refuse to refund.
  
  So its monopoly of flipkart and they sell these type of faulty piece to customer to just improve their sells.
  
  They don't need now old customer.
  

  This is very bad experience with flipkart .
  
  I m suffering this phone. And service centers are also not replyed satiafactory answer
  
  So my suggestion is don't ever buy from flipkart
  
  Dont buy any product from flipkart they are very rude and full business man they dont need customer they just want to sell bad product like this.

Both back and rear camera are amazing.  It's has a good Battery life, I use it whole day with single charge in the morning and thoughtout usage of internet and all my app.
  
  Ear phone is worst for takeing calls (voice becomes low with full volume of phone) ,  it's good only for music. Suggest u to take a better earphone.
  
  I m using this phone since 4months, sometime it's started hanging, screen turns completely blank. I have to then restart it back.
  
  Rather then this issue, I don't find any other reason of not buying this phone.
  

  Rest all is amazing!!! Worth for money...

  It's a nice looking phone for selfies, buy in my opinion Moto M, Moto G5 plus  and sony Xperia A1 are smarter choices.

Kumar Abhishek,08bd3a71fa2e4fd582d31643cfb9bf2b,"OPPO F1s (Rose Gold, 64 GB)",MOBEQCQVGHRKYZEZ,4,Good choice,"Purchased this mobile in the big billion sale 2 weeks back. Having a nice experience within the 2 weeks of usage. Here goes the review:
  

  Pros
  
  1. Good looks.
  
  2. Device is lightweight.
  
  3.Screenguard and Silicone case were included.
  
  4. Simple UI. Basically a replica of iOS.
  
  5. Very responsive mostly due to 4GB RAM.
  

  No major cons noticed till now. Although display is only 1024X880p still it seems seamless and nice.
  

  Overall a good buy under 10k.

  Pros
  
  1. Looks superb
  
  2. Sim tray with 2 nano sim slot+ sd card slot....best about this phone
  
  3. Screen is undoubtedly good
  
  4. Fingerprint scanner works superb
  
  5. No hanging whatsoever
  
  6. Battery backup is good for a 3075 mAh battery...works full day with a single charge
  
  7. Camera. Needless to say about it. Oppo first sells it camera than the phone. Front (16MP) is beter than rear(13MP)
  

  Cons
  
  1. Android 5.1.... For a price this range OS could have been upgraded
  
  2. User interface....its very basic, little or no customisation at all.
  
  3. Color OS.....nothing but copy of iOS....till looks it is okay to copy apple....but OS also
  
  4.  Led notification light is just a waste of space. Doesnt turn on while charging...and notifications also only half the time

  Having a front selfie Camera of resolution 16 mega pixels is one of the biggest advantages of selfies than which is best than an #iPhone selfie in clarity of the photos...
  

  And 64 gb variant that is for a good price the only negative point of the mobile is its 720p pixel paying a rupees of 19000/- and getting a 720p screen is some disappointing thing.
  

  The looks are really awesome u can feel that you are carrying an iPhone in your hand.
  

  Overall a good phone for gaming,  selfies,  looks (design)  and ram and memory.  If u guys intrested in buying a mobile in the range of 17-20 thousand you can buy it without a doubt.

Must say it has turned out to be a amazing ph above my expectations..camera is very good, Battery is supportive enough to last 24 hr with regular usage of ph calls social networking listening music. No lags while using multiple apps. The only disappointment is the old android system..5.1 lollipop with no clue so as when the sytem shall be upgraded or will never b updated..people who are not much techsavy n really give a damn to which android version they are using its a win win game for them in all aspects. Again thank u flipkart for such an amazing opportunity to make this phone available with exchange offer otherwise i would have never bought this ph for 19000 rs.

Camera quality is the best part  in this mobile. Display touch, fingerprint sensor and feather touch are fabulous and super  quick responsive. Battery capacity also less when compare to other mobiles in this price,  but it perfectly takes you a day of normal use of mobile. It doesn't comes with android 6.0, but they tried for Color-Os which is nice and easy to handle.
  
  Here are some pros and cons i suggest after i using it for 10 days,
  
  Pros:
  
  1. Good Build quality
  
  2. Good Camera quality both front and rear
  
  3. Super responsive fingerprint sensor
  
  4. Loud Speaker is so good
  
  5. Color-OS is very nice
  
  6. Supports VOLTE and OTG
  
  Cons:
  
  1. Price
  
  2. Battery only 3075mAh
  
  3. Android 5.1
  

  If you want to buy this mobile please wait for an offer otherwise go with lenovo k5 note or redmi note 4 which are giving medium camera quality

  Cons:
  
  1) Does not have new android system so new games and new applications does not working properly in thus phone
  
  2) Battery problems are common in this phone
  
  I have complained of it for twice but it seems the same
  
  3) full charged battery last longer for only 1 day
  
  4) does not have that much new features as compare to MI note 4. Even processor is very slow so that it runs very slow and hang problems while playing high resolution games
  
  5) does not support fluently VR mode
  
  5) expensive compare to MI note 4 Samsung j7prime Lenovo vibe k5 and they r far better then this dabba phone
  
  6) go for MI note 4 or samsung or Even lenovo is better then this
  

  Overall this phone does not deserve this much price and not even updated with latest android version please go for different phone

Considering all other brands are giving full HD display in this price range, this Mobile still has 1320x720 display. For a 5.5 screen HD ready is not enough. also after 3 months of usage, i have noticed that the battery is draining faster than usual.
  

  Also the UI and user experience of the software is not very smooth as other brands.
  

  Okayish product, go for it if you are getting it in a good deal.

  3 star only for the camera and software version
  
  1.Cameras good but only for day time photography front camera  gives good pics then  back camera 
  
  But for night photography both are useless
  
  2. Android 5 which is already an outdated version still in this phone and don't know when this phone get upadets .
  
  3. Battery almost 3k mah not bad doesn't support fast charging but still charge faster with given charger.
  
  4. 4gbRAM and processor combined gives flawless performance.

If we take selfies standing b4 beautiful landscapes or buildings the cam will highlight you and slightly dull the background making the shot itself a waste. Lots of apps won't work in this mobile.

However software wise I did not find Oppo mobiles up to the mark. Even in high end phones like F1s they are still using Android 5.1 (Lollipop). On contacting Oppo they say that an upgrade to Marshmallow will be rolled out soon but they have not decided a specific date and time (this was before 3 months and there is still no sign of update).
  

  Only massive hardware doesn't serve the purpose. A good and latest software is required to keep up with the hardware.
  

  I would not suggest to buy Oppo and Vivo phones. This is my last Oppo phone and I am not buying these Chinese brands henceforth.

  Its a very good camera phone. Photos from both front and rear camera are gorgeous. Beautify mode really works awesome.
  
  Average battery life. Gets through the day for moderate usage.
  
  Now the fun begins. Having massive 4 GB RAM is not enough. Poor memory management considering its price tag. OS is very heavy. Not customizable at all.
  
  And god that very poor processor. Feels like I'm in 2013, holding a basic samsung phone. It doesn't justify the price. Never buy this phone except for camera. Only camera.
  
  And last but not least, the OS. Still running on Android 5.0 when android 8.0 is announced and will be released soon. Oppo announced its upgrade from lollipop to marshmallow in first week of May, 2017. Four and half months later also, we don't have any news about the update. Never ever buy Oppo phone. I made a huge mistake! God bless Oppo.

Abhishek Shaw,18af954444f54d5ea34f80a12767a49e,"OPPO F3 Plus (Black, 64 GB)",MOBESTGFSK2SMEHK,5,Just wow!,"First let me inform you about a very important thing to those buyers who are complaining that they haven't received the earphone, please check the box properly, the earphone is just below where the USB cable was kept.
  

  Now coming to the phone, which I purchased for just 10,800  (in 12 months zero cost EMI with my HDFC credit card) by exchanging my 1.5 years old Moto X style at 12,000 . Thanks flipkart and oppo for this great deal!
  

  This phone is definitely overpriced, and if it's priced between 15-20k then it's really a good buy!
  

  I'm using this phone since last 4 days, and here's positive and negative impressions:
  

  Camera: The rear 16mp camera is really great. It captures some great shots in daylight, indoor light and low light. You'll get great bokeh effect because of it's 1.7f aperture. The flash is bright too.
  

  The front 16mp selfie camera is one of the best I've ever seen. It captures great details and bright selfies at all lighting conditions. The 8mp wide angle lens is very wide for group selfies the quality is quite good. Though it lacks details and in low light it attracts noise. But I'm not impressed with it's bokeh mode. First, the bokeh mode works in beauty mode only which makes the photo artificial and second it's not able to differentiate properly between the subject and background. As a result you'll see your hair, shoulders are getting blurred. Oppo needs to update the camera app so that we can take the advantage of the dual selfie camera properly. So basically it's a phone with two front camera not dual camera.
  

  Build quality and design: The build quality is good because of metal body. Special thanks to oppo for providing good soft transparent cover and pre applied screen guard out of the box.
  

  Performance: The performance is really smooth because of SD652 and 4gb ram. I haven't find any hiccups while doing daily task of browsing, social networking, camera, gaming etc. I've also noticed that the os use very less RAM in comparison to with other phones. Take example of my Mi A1 where the total ram is 3.5gb and in this phone the total ram is around 3.8 gb. But one big flaw in this color os is the ram management. The os often freeze the apps which run in background like internet speed meter, Ad blocker etc. As a result I miss the notification of whatsapp, Facebook etc. I'm still trying to find a way to resolve this.
  

  Display: The corning gorilla glass 5 protected 6 inch is very bright and colourful. But it's highly saturated too. The display os on the warmer side and unfortunately you can't change the color temperature. Due to this the skin tone of people while watching videos looks red, yellow and pinkish.
  

  Sound: The sound quality is nice. Speaker volume is adequately loud. The real HD sound equalizer by oppo didn't excited me much. Dolby atmos and my Mi A1 sound output is much better. The earphone is decent, nothing special.
  

  Call: The call quality is good and the network reception is also fine with my Jio 4g.
  

  Finger print: The finger print sensor is one of the fastest. But personally I prefer finger print on rear side. Due to the size of the phone it's bit difficult to unlock it with your thumb everytime.
  

  OS and software: I didn't liked the color OS at all. It's really far behind MiUi. There's not much customization  option you'll get. Wish they improve it with update and hope I'll get nougat update.
  

  Battery: I'm yet to test the 4000mah battery properly, will add my feedback after a week or two. But I'm really impressed with the fast VOOC charging which is blazingly fast. It charges the phone from 15 to 90 in just an hour and fully charged the phone in approx 90 minutes.
  

  Overall I'm very much satisfied with my 10,800  spent on this selfie expert. I've never thought or planned that I'll ever use oppo smartphones, but seriously guys if you're getting such huge discount deals, and okay with some flaws which I've mentioned above  then go for it! I'm sure you'll not regret it.

Rajesh T G,5df2bedf1008490a9b9b31012ae9ebd8,"OPPO F3 Plus (Black, 64 GB)",MOBESTGFSK2SMEHK,3,Above-average product,"Good camera centric phone. Even lthough I am not happy with the pricing, the phone is a good performer in terms of camera, battery life, call  and data, media.
  

  The build quality of this phone is good and looks like a member of iPhone family. The full HD screen is vibrant and the colours appears to be over saturated. There is no option in the phone to set the colour balance. Viewing angles of the screen are great and also the outdoor visibility is good too.
  

  There is no lag in the phone's daily performance. Memory management implementation is good thanks to the 4 GB RAM. Call quality is loud and clear even with volte.
  

  Camera performance is good in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions but the OIS implementation is above average only. If you are not careful you will end up with shaky images.
  

  Battery life is okay and it can easily last for a full day with moderate usage.
  

  The phone is good for multimedia. Audio from headphone sounds great with real HD option turned on. It even sound better than Lenovo vibe X3.
  

  Now about the cons I observed in the phone. Many people especially those who have used Samsung or Nexus phone would not appreciate the experience of color os. The phone's price never justifies it's hardware. Offline models like vivo V5 plus (having almost similar specs) are sold for a much cheaper price. Future software updates are a big question mark. The phone launched in 2017 still run on the almost outdated marshmallow os.
  

  Overall it a good phone. I'll recommend this phone over Samsung Galaxy A and C series phone.

  Advantages:
  
  Screen display quality is awesome. Rich feeling.
  

  You can change display font by using third party app (ifont). But in f3 you don't have that option.
  

  Battery backup is good. Awesome fast charging.
  

  FAST finger print sensor. Working very nice.
  
  Camera picture quality is good.
  

  Color os operating system is really designed well. It gives rich feeling while using the phone.
  

  Third party launchers are working fine with this phone. (N launcher, nova launcher, etc).
  

  Notification settings are nice.
  

  Inbuilt app security lock is nice (finger print app lock and passcode lock)
  

  Battery backup in standby mode is awesome.
  

  Music player sound effect is good (maybe depends on headphone quality).
  

  Phone looks very good when handling and very slim.
  

  Disadvantages:
  

  Phone relased before more than six months but still running in marshmallow.
  

  Color os 3.2 released in oppo f5 but it still running in 3.0
  

  Phone is getting heat While using camera for more than 5 minutes.
  

  No NFC Connectivity in this highly priced  phone.
  

  Audio output is low in outdoors and indoors. Only hearable at night (while others sleeping)
  

  Gorilla glass 5 but I got a small scratch on my display even i maintained well. Don't know what is the use of Gorilla 5 glass.
  

  And its 2.5d curved display is irritating when the tempered glass is not fit in to the display. But without tempered glass phone looks awesome but i don't want to take risk.
  

  Conclusion:
  
  You can buy this phone if the manufacturer gives proper software updates regularly at least up to Oreo ( because of high price). Otherwise its a very very Awesome phone in the market..

  I am using this phone since 1 week and i liked it very much. I always used big brand products and i was thinking whether  to buy it or not but i like specification on paper a lot and with good exchange value i buy this phone.
  
  Now come to point
  
  1.Design it slim and superb looking phn jst like i phn i fall in love with this beuty after i saw it. P
  
  2.Processor is very fast doesnt heat even at high uses while charging also, power managment to good in this processor very good at long day uses.
  
  3.Screen it is large 6"" screen but phn size is nt uncomfortable it is easy to hold for boy atleast,  even though it is tft display it gives u very superior quality of visuals from any angle ppi is very good here for sharo images
  
  4.Camera now come to tag line for this phn sual selfie  camera so not to mention both camera has a good ability to capture good images. You dont need selfie stick any more with his wide angle secondry front camera,  to my suprice rear camera is too good at tgis price and they didnt even advertise about it belive me its better thn front camera and they didnt even mentioned it.
  
  5.Battery as per my thinking i was confused about 4000mah battery for large 6"" display and how long it wiil last but they manage it so well even  after heavy uses like surfing, downloading, wathching movies it last all day. I dindt play games so sorry dnt nw abt tht hw lng it wil last with heavy games.  But for decent user it far more than enough.
  
  6.charger if u ask me charger is best thing i like in this mobile it charge my phn upto 50% in just  30 minutes or less may be i liked it very much nw i dont need to carry power bank just beacause i forget to charge my phn. Now with this charger in very shrt time i will get day long charged phn loving it. Its vooc 4amp 5v charger.
  
  7.Os louncher- its colour Os it was little dificult for me to adjust to this os beacause i never had any chinese phn before but i liked this simple, fast and responsive doest take ram for unworthy stuff like animation widgets and blah blah blah.... It gives u what u need nothing unecessory adede to it keeps phn simple and lag free
  
  8.Music Chip-they didnt even tell us what they used vuts it best music i heard so far with this phn and its headphones its superb feels like uvr living in the musin mesmorising.
  
  So i dont see any flaws with this phn ya but price tag of 25000 makes you reconsider but you got nice exchange offer so it wil be good around 20,000 and to my notice its farrrrrrrr better thn vivo v7+ in every angle. So buy it.

  1) Camera Jus 10/10. I compared its camera wid all flagship..like I 7+, V7+, and One plus 5...but all got fail in every environment..
  

  2) Am a big multitasker but when it comes in phone all phone start showinn their lagging at some point.  but This i would say best in all because of its Ram and latest Processor.
  

  3) Battery is just aswesome now i forget when i last carry my power bank with me... because it has 4000 MaH battery with VOOC Charge that ...Charges my phone from 0-100% in jus 50 Minutes...

Amaresh Narayanan,d03bde3f46f74135adb3c83e75d23abf,"OPPO F3 Plus (Black, 64 GB)",MOBESTGFSK2SMEHK,4,Genuine review after 10 days use,"Overall Mobile is Good.
  

  1. Actually, this mobile is not worth for 25K (as shown in flipkart), but I bought this mobile for ~15K on exchange offer (25K - (8000 exchange off + 700 for my 5 years old Moto G mobile + 1600 HDFC card discount) = ~15K).
  
  2. The front camera is Very Good, frankly speaking, my face is oiled face, but the selfy comes like a fresh face. So, selfy lovers can go for this mobile. Quick focus and quick shoot.
  
  3. Back came is also good, but not like the front camera. Quick focus and quick shoot.
  
  4. Sometimes, I felt slowness (but not hanging) while normal operations. Not major
  
  5. The fingerprint is very slow, previously I was using ""LeEco Le 1S"", in that Fingerprint is very quick. but in Oppo F3 Plus, I have to hold and wait for .5 to 1 second. This is annoying everytime.
  
  6. 6inch screen is very big (previously I was using 5.5inch mobile), initially I felt very big, but its ok now (no other way. :-) ). We have to use both the hands for typing.
  

  If you are normal user (not Game player) and selfy lover, just go for it.

First of all thanks to flipkart  for the fabulous exchange offer... 6000 off and 8000 exchange bonus... Bought the phone for 12.5k on exchange of my 1.5 year old Samsung J7.
  

  PROS
  
  6 inch colourful screen is a pleasure to watch videos....
  
  5000 Mah battery  lasts up-to 2days on moderate  usage...
  
  Amazing picture quality especially  for front camera.... Back camera is good Too
  
  No difficulty  in migrating from my Samsung  (using since 2013) since both have a lot similarity
  
  Finger print ID is very agile and handy...
  
  Sound quality  is fine ...
  
  Even though  it is using the older generation Snapdragon 653  processor it not getting hang can navigate  easily  between apps...
  
  Build quality  is good...
  
  Dual sim and expandable memory are other plus points
  
  Feels like iPhone in certain aspects.
  
  Comes with free screen guard and back cover...
  
  CONS
  
  Could  have used the latest 835 Snapdragon
  
  Especially  when you consider that it's priced around 30 and competors  like one plus 3T are using latest Snapdragon....

  Final conclusion:- in my personal opinion I love screen awesome reproduction  of colours, fingerprint ultra fast, and I love rear camera than front both in day and night, front cam day performance awesome ,struggle slot in low light.
  
  I recommend it over moto g5s plus, miA1 for camera and processor, but In case of ram management and UI both 2 are awesome then this.

Just unbelievable  keep it up flipkart.  Product is best in this price.as for the phone every spec is good but I'll the screen on banking gateways is very sluggish. May be that is the reason why iPhone and Samsung are the leaders apart from that aspect I find nothing inferior  the highly price phone.  It is money you pay for their brands (highly paid managers, software engineers etc. ) I suggest opposite f3 plus moreover as modulo says make in India yes oppo!!!

Rajan Bhasin,5125b855e23d4d8ba446173292eab952,"OPPO F3 Plus (Black, 64 GB)",MOBESTGFSK2SMEHK,4,Best in class.,"This is the best phone in this class but not the best. Price is very high compare to its specifications. It was available for 24990 whent I bought this. Thanks to Flipkart sale. I got this one at 16000 approx under exchange and bank offer. I exchange Lenovo K3 note by which i got extra 5000 discount + phone value + 1500 bank discount. It is amazing experience for me.
  

  Now about the phone:-
  

  Best feature of this phone is its VOOC Charging technology. Phone can charge around 80% in 35 minutes.
  

  Secondly dual fromt camera which is amazing in day and night shots. It is specially designed for group selfies. Rear camera is also at satisfactory level.
  

  Processing speed is good as it comes with 1.96 ghz octa core processor with 4gb ram.
  

  The main issue i am facing is its software. It is still running on android marshmallow 6.0 whereas all other smartphones in this range are already powerd by android 7.1.1 and ready for android 8 too. I have gone through my research and find out that Oppo have no plans to release software update in coming months which is big disadvantage. Oppo is not good at all on software updates.
  

  Screen size is huge and cannot use single handed. I think it is more comfortable if it is 5.5. However, you can use it by one hand by compressing the screen. Resolution, screen colors are good and seems natural.

  Bad ones about the phone
  

  1) This phone still runs on Android M,  color os 3.0. With oppo f5 being already out,  not sure when or if this phone gets android N or O updates.
  

  2) Screen looks very saturated, everything looks darker in color than usual.
  

  3) This phone is  overpriced, you get same set of features in Xiaomi at 16k-17k. Processor could have been snapdragon 835 in order to justify this huge price.
  

  4) Color OS UI is still very much novice,  need a lot of improvements. It is least of all the UI's.
  



  Good ones about the phone.
  

  1) Phone size is huge also very sleek, looks premium at hands
  

  2) Cameras,   both rear and front gives you very detailed and awesome pics.  Better than average expectations.
  

  3) Comes with 4A fast charger,charges 10% in 5 mins, 90% in 1h 10 mins,  and 100% in 1.5 hours.
  

  4) Fingerprint sensor is quicker
  

  5) Comes with tempered glass applied and transparent silicon case, good quality earphones provided. You dont have to spill extra 1000 bucks for these.
  


  Verdict::
  

  If you are looking to flaunt your premium phone and a camera philic guy, without worrying too much on UI and software updates. Go for it.

Himanshu,5c969217c917492ea09769a3a588e5a0,"OPPO F3 Plus (Black, 64 GB)",MOBESTGFSK2SMEHK,5,Wonderful,"This is not an average phone but it is much bigger than than a 5.5 inch one. However, the screen to body ratio is 75% and above and hence a large portion of the front face is covered with screen. The weight is also good at 185gms.  the battery life is really good and for me lasts more than a day with routine use and minor gaming. I do not use 3g or 4g on the phone as the SIM card is ordinary 2g one. Inuse WiFi on it almost full day. A transparent silicon cover  is provided in the box. It fits vey snugly and looks good too. No to some pros and cons
  

  Pros
  
  Great screen. Display is crisp and vibrant. It also has blue light filter option. Touchscreen is good and responsive. Doesn't feel flimsy and overall phone build is awesome.
  
  Battery life is really good. Vooc charging is awesome.
  
  Down firing speaker is quite loud to make phone calls and for music or movies
  
  Weight and form factor is really good.
  
  Cameras are good too. But I did not find them truly awesome. Also, I don't do a lot of photography with mobile
  
  Provided head phones are good. They produce decent sound for voice and music
  

  Cons
  
  Charging with ordinary charger is slow. Vooc charger is big in size. So carrying it might not be possible for all
  
  All rocker buttons should have been on one side of the phone. That is volume key should be above power key. It's difficult to use volume keys. Also, the software for volume should provide a slider to adjust volume for phone, music, alarm etc...no such slider provided
  
  The touch buttons at bottom of screen bleed white light, so it looks kind of cheap.
  

  Overall a great phone. Flipkart provided fantastic exchange offer. The person who came for delivery was patient and polite and worked through the exchange process calmly with us. Thank you Flipkart for that.
  

  Ps: I knew before purchasing that the phone might not get latest android updates. I do miss features that are provided in android 7, but this is an informed decision I took. So not taking away credit from the phone itself

  Packing  of phone  is good.
  
  Phone,  Box,  charger,  handsfree all are brand new and well packed.
  
  I god 12k discount  on exchange of my lenovo k5 note.
  
  Now come to the phone...
  
  Front camera is awesome and back camera is also camera : very good  only one thing in camera is there is no flash on front  camera. 10/10
  


  Battery : battry backup and charging  is very good.  Charge 70% in less then 30min.
  
  After full charge  stay 1 full day of use (including  play online  game,  movie,  YouTube and downlow)
  
  I m maximum  playing online game.  In past if i played game for 2 hours battery gone more thn 50% bt now with  this phone after 3 hours of continues  playing game and 1hour watching  online video it consumes only 35%.
  
  No heating  while playing game which was terrible  in my lenovo k5.  10/10
  

  Performance  : its good and fast everything  done just by ur touch.  10/10
  

  Looking : awesome  bt now a days all r using back cover and tuffen so dosnt matter.  10/9
  

  Display : its good and bright also there is eye protection  option. 10/9
  

  Desige : it slim and not so big to carry in pocket bt not easy  to use  by one hand.
  
  10/9
  

  Price : in regular  price its too high compared to other phone  bt if u got it around  20k its a best deal
  

  If u r thinking  to buy it i suggest u to definitely  buy bt if u got good deal on it.

Samsung C9 pro was out of reach. To my horror the selfie expert was over heating and the selfies were blurr and reddish. However back camera pics were too good. But I was damm frustated and wanted refund as i took this phone for selfies. But could only apply for exchange. Meanwhile i did the factory reset on advice of flipkart technical expert. And to my amaze all defects were removed. The selfies turned out too nice ie beyound my expectation. The SD 652 is ultra fast and fast charging a gem in itself. Finally satisfed with my phone and too happy. There is no front flash but u dont need it either with OF3+ until u wish to take selfies in complete darkness. If u get a perfect operational phone than think no beyound in this price range for class leading camera experience and blazing fast performance.

  Exchanged my OnePlus One, Which was an excellent phone.. Never had any issues over the past three years..  but no regrets.. This seems to be an awesome phone as well.. Got this one for a reasonable price of Rs12590 after exchange and also with a good buy back deal from flipkart.
  

  Would have been 5 stars if the phone comes with Android N.. Atleast hoping oppo will update the software until then 4 stars for oppo f3 plus

  This is the best android mobile. I have used past one week. See my comments below:
  

  1. Camera - 9/10
  
  2. Battery backup - 8.5/10
  
  3. Speed & Performance - 9/10
  
  4. Display - 9.5/10
  
  5. Marshmallow 6.0.1 is very good performance.
  
  6.  OPPO need to work on its software.
  
  7.It doesn't support JIO video calling...may be OPPO need to work on it.
  

  Overall is good and one negative thing is its COLOR OS.
  

  Finally I would like to say THANK YOU SO MUCH Flipkart and team members...

  Super fast delivery of Flipkart.
  
  This is a true selfie camera phone, the quality of photos is amazing, even better than Iphone 5s.
  
  The second best feature is its color os best on android. I am an iOS person but this os amazed me with its ease and its pretty simple to operate.
  
  Screen resolution quality and battery backup is amazing.
  
  Another small but important aspect I noticed that it comes with screen guard protector and a transparent case, very thoughtful, you dont need to worry about properly pasting a hard glass screen protector and its quality.
  
  I use this as my 2nd phone as primarily I use iPhone but this has impressed me a lot and its far better than the moto phones.

Phone software same as like iphone .utilities like cleaner , antivirus, file manager good so no need of third party apps, Apps cannot be moved to sd so , downloading heavy games is sure trouble , Music in ear decent with bundled earphone do not expect more it just entry level midsegment phone. Camera output good as display is great. Support volte 4g. Gestures control is good. Looks like premium phone as display is bright and body is metalic and in unibody form.Battery backup cant be judged in few day usage but overall battery performance is not bad. Low battery mode is sure good use. Scratch guard already there, silicon cover in box. Screen is bright but finger print magnet, it is problem only when phone is used in bright sunlight condition and display is set at low light .
  
  So overall good buy in this segment, a value for your hard earned money.

  Have bought OppoA37 on 4th Aug which was launched a week back.
  
  Every website will talk about the prons and will not talk about the issues with the phone, even retailers. Here is what you should know before you make you decision.
  

  Cons:
  
  1) Apps can't move to SD card, which means you will have only 2GB space to use or download any applications. (This is like medieval age phone feature). You will not be able to use 16GB ROM space for your applications. Hence give a serious through about any Oppo phone. I have checked this features for all Oppo serious by visiting Oppo store.
  

  The funny thing was: Not a single counter sales man (even Oppo exclusive stores) was aware about this issue.
  
  2) UI: Although it looks good, but have many operational issues while handling the phone.
  
  a) Multi-touch action is not good: You can't delete multiple messages, Contact at a time. You need to inside every message/contact and then delete them individually.
  

  2) Phone gets heats up, even if I am on call for more than 25-30 min.
  
  3) Battery is decent, don't expect to last for more than a day. It can just last for max a day.
  
  4) Camera is decent. Not bad.
  
  5) Earphones are against not up to the standard. You may need to buy a one for better sound.
  

  Pros:
  
  1) Apple look alike phone, so you will feel good feeling while carrying this phone.
  
  2) Display is of good quality, premium looking
  
  3) Looks tough phone (too early to say anything on this, but this so far my experience)
  
  4) Camera is decent, don't expect too much from it. The pics get blurred the moment you zoom the pictures.
  

  To summarize - It's a big ""NO"" for any OPPO phones. Because:
  
  1) You will have limited space 2GB - 3GB for your App, which is too less in today technology. It's like you are going back 7-8 years in terms of technology.
  
  2) You will have many options at this price (Xiaomi Note 3 and series are very good phone - Just go for it).
  

  Yes: Only because of look and feel of the product.

You will regret for life myself .Their is an error while downloading apps from play store, downloading anything from google, gmail, chrome etc.  You won't recieve any notifications from different apps forget your Daily Dose of news. The keyboard is pathetic, its an everest to climb typing or editing with this. The customer care is so despondent if you drop a mail regarding your problem they will respond after 10 days asking for more details and when you send those you still don't get any response. Settings and interface are too pathetic and you can't customize any thing as per your requirements.
  
  Statutory warning Plz don't buy it.

Dont go into the hardselling the phone shops offer rather compare closely other phones .
  

  Battery: Terible doesnt last more then 7 hrs with whatsapp, facebook and Inshorts loaded
  
  Camera: only the one that deserves accolades
  
  Network finder: Junk P.O.S. I am surprised coz my Nokie E63 yes the old Nokia E63 performs better when it comes to network finding.
  
  HANGS!!! HANGS Just HANGS.. heats up on charging... heats up with kept in your coin box of your car...
  

  I have a prejudice against this coz I am comparing OPPO F37 with Asus Zenfone 2 Laser which not only has lesser radiation (SAR values) but a phenomenal phone with a 13 MP & 5Mp camera, a fantastic network ability, easy software, easy backup, doesnt hang up. Well priced...
  

  Before you make a purchase think twice thrice !!

  I am not happy with this lack of feature.

  I was lucky to get this device I day b4 launch.
  
  This phone is very good looking,  Slim,  it looks like iPhone6 copy.
  
  Pros:
  
  1) I have never seen the fast finger print sensor. It's lightning fast. Less than a sec I can tell.
  
  2) front Cam is 16mp it's not bad at all. DSLR affect
  
  3) dedicated memory card slot (32gb)  inbuilt though
  
  4) decent batter life. I cud test only for aday
  
  5)bettr display 1080p at least better than
  
  Rs 16900 j7prime LCD display
  
  6)user friendly UI
  
  7)music is good with headphones on its something new Dirac live music feel
  
  Cons :
  
  1) headphones Jack pin in base very odd place,  ddifficult to hold phone with headphones on.
  
  2)though processor is Snapdragon 435 I felt it was bit lazy.
  
  So this is the end,  plz tell me,  reply bck,  if any clarification. Thank u

Everything about this phone was almost good until I purchased Micromax evok note(I purchase mobile for all the family members of my huge family).
  
  After comparing both below is my observation:
  

  Pros:
  
  Selfie camera(16MP)
  
  Smooth touch.
  
  Got it at a discounted price at 13,583. Good service by flipkart.
  
  Good looks specially if we don't use cover.
  
  Supports VR due to gyroscope.
  

  Cons:
  
  Screen is a dull, so it's not a fun to use and to watch videos. At this price, at least full hd screen should be there. Biggest drawback.
  
  Need to charge it before the day ends. Battery is 2900 mAH.
  
  Overpriced. May be due to 16MP front camera.
  

  Suggestion: Best for selfie lovers not for mobile lovers.

  At a budget of 15,000 there are many more options like redmi note 4, honor 6x, coolpad cool 1....then why buy it???
  
  Many people will say that the highlighting point of this phone is it's camera...so what honor 6x and coolpad cool 1also have a very good camera...
  

  Pros:
  
  Has a good camera
  

  Cons:
  
  Low processor ie SD 430
  
  Only 720p screen
  
  not good battery 2900mah

  the very first thing i have to tell about Oppo A57 mobile is it so much LIGHT weight.
  
  Fast Fingr prnt scannr.
  
  Camera is awesome both Front and Back.
  
  while it has only 2900 mh battery it is ok for regular usage of smartphone apart from heavy usage.
  
  the processing speed is also gud.
  
  its a good n nice mobile for ppl who looking for more camera work.

  1) Great camera performance. Both front and back cameras are the best in this price range.
  
  2) nice and simple UI
  
  3) Iphone copy..  Looks like a 5.2inch iphone..
  
  4) No hanging till now.  Its got 3gb of ram So hanging will not be an issue.
  
  5) Battery life is below average.
  
  6)good display
  
  7)Heats up fast...
  
  Guys i am not a smartphone maniac.  I am an average user who uses social networking apps like facebook, instagram,  whatsapp etc. And i watch youtube videos in between. And i am judging the battery life on this type of usage..
  
  Hope this review helps.  Thankyou

Shoeb Mohammad,3c2c92bd332944f78ecc36565527e6ba,"OPPO A57 (Gold, 32 GB)",MOBEQT93GWRUD5BQ,4,Good quality product,"I purchased this phone from the Store after doing a lot of research and comparisons. I must say that this phone is literally a must buy in this segment. Build quality is awsome   and gives an iPhone like feel,  also performance is very smooth and camera is decent.  A quick finger print scanner adds more value to it. Speaking of performance, I have been using this phone since March 1 and hasn't faced any issues yet. One star deducted for not putting the option of switching the storage location as I have to move the photos and video's manually or may be I am missing something. Overall it is an expert, competing in the market. Good work oppo.

  With a 6 days of use im writing this review.
  
  I preordered this device on 9th may and on 13th [its release day] i hot the mobile.
  
  But they didnt give bahubali case when i contact them they have given 150/- wallet.but i got selfie stick which is nice.
  

  Pros:
  
  1] 16 + 8 mp camera. Exellent . [GIF, ULTRA HD, EXPERT MODE]  
  
  2] back camera 13mp is very nice and no shutter lag. [GIF, ULTRA HD, EXPERT MODE]
  
  3] 5.5FHD display.
  
  4] Super fast finger print scanner. [0.2seconds]
  
  5] 51.5GB usable ROM
  
  6] Full charging within 2 hours.
  
  7] 12 hours battery back up for heavy user. If we dont use Net it has last for 1 & 1/2 day.
  
  8] VOLTE support with clear voice.
  
  9] super autobrightness screen and eye protection also.
  
  10] light weight and slim model easy to handle.
  

  Cons.
  
  1] Video options are not there like slow motion . Only 720p and 1080p for both cameras.
  
  2] while charging phone heating observed.
  
  3] in 4GB RAM it is showing only 1.95GB RAM available .
  
  4] Little bit over priced. It would have the price 16k.
  
  .
  
  Conclusion:
  
  If ur a camera / photo lover buy this phone without any hesitation.

Camera on clicking took few min to open & was black out during the time & video was not showing the timer, unable to shoot & access. Later reported to flipkart, advised us to reset. But camera problem occured again aftr 3 days. Took few min to open & black out during the time & video also took time but the timer was showing this time. This time i video tape that issue in another phone. As i dont want to do reset again & again to make this new phone spending 20000/-, reported again to flipkart about the issue & asked for replacement. They started their protocols. Even aftr technicians visit, saw the problem in video tape, accept its geniune but because it didnt occur at that particular time he wrote the report problem resolved instead of problem didnt occured that time . So flipkart got away wid the excuses for replacement.
  
  Flipkart you are making an bad impression in my mind regarding the defective product replacement, which i video tape. Making me to go CONSUMER FORUM as i having geniuene problem withe proof.

This phone is good for those who love taking selfies and photos on the go. Using on ideal basis, the phone performs decent without any issues. The picture quality of the camera is in great. One of the best feature of front camera is that it has a wide view mode which covers at-least 50 more area than  normal camera. On a normal use basis, the battery gives 1 day backup. I have not checked for gaming performance since I am not a big fan of gaming activity. The color OS is not so great but you will get used to it once you starting using. Below is the Cons and Pros for the product:
  

  Cons:
  
  -Not an AMOLED display
  
  -Color OS not so impressive
  
  -Battery backup just for a day
  



  Pros:
  
  -Wide view front Camera
  
  -Impressive Beauty mode camera
  
  -64 GB in built memory with 4 GB of RAM
  
  -Dedicated slot each for 2 Sims and 1 memory card
  
  -Fast fingerprint response
  
  -Great external speaker quality, doesn't distort when on high volume.
  
  -Transparent back-cover and screengaurd, ejector pin & earphone included.

  Overall it is good but lacks in battery capacity because price range is higher if compared the same features in other brands like Mi which has good build quality with less price. Opportunity spends a lot of money of advertisment by celebrities therefore they will have to keep the price a little higher claiming that their product is best. But ideally either price should be a little lower or improve the build quality and battery capacity because phones are good but they are very delicate.

  Not able to connect the bluetooth phone audio.
  
  Keyboard is old.  No gif available.
  
  Camera quality is also not that good(which they call their USP. A 10000 rs phones also click the same quality pictures.
  
  Dual camera is not worth.
  
  When you can get the same qualities for half the price then why to spend money on these so call oppo phones.
  
  Earphones provided with the phone are below standard.
  
  And now i can replace it as i can only replace it within 10 days. Come on flipkart stop selling these kind of phones

I am very happy with flipkart exchange offer. Very quickly delivered by FK. I have some issue with the mobile. Then I claimed for the replacement. Flipkart accepted my request and gave me another OPPO F3. I would like to share my experience with my OPPO F3 after 3months,
  
  Pros: 1.Great selfie camera and good rear camera
  
  2. Fast finger print scanner
  
  3.Fast charging and long lasting battery backup are very good
  
  4. Very nice phone on this price range we can go for.
  
  5.No heating issues even after long time game plays of heavy games
  

  Cons:
  
  1. Photos taken on low light is not up to the mark, very blur photos even the selfie cam.
  
  2. Overall performance is good, but the available RAM is only 2.1 GB on starting the mobile. In most of the cases available RAM is only 1.5GB even there is no background apps are running. This is the only backlog with this mobile. Even my friend's 3GB ram mobile has its 2.3 gb available ram on start.

  Fast Fingr prnt scannr.
  
  Camera is awesome both Front and Back.
  
  while it has only 2900 mh battery it is ok for regular usage of smartphone apart from heavy usage.
  
  the processing speed is also gud.
  
  its a good n nice mobile for ppl who looking for more camera work.

  1) Great camera performance. Both front and back cameras are the best in this price range.
  
  2) nice and simple UI
  
  3) Iphone copy..  Looks like a 5.2inch iphone..
  
  4) No hanging till now.  Its got 3gb of ram So hanging will not be an issue.
  
  5) Battery life is below average.
  
  6)good display
  
  7)Heats up fast...
  
  Guys i am not a smartphone maniac.  I am an average user who uses social networking apps like facebook, instagram,  whatsapp etc. And i watch youtube videos in between. And i am judging the battery life on this type of usage..
  
  Hope this review helps.  Thankyou

I must say that this phone is literally a must buy in this segment. Build quality is awsome   and gives an iPhone like feel,  also performance is very smooth and camera is decent.  A quick finger print scanner adds more value to it. Speaking of performance, I have been using this phone since March 1 and hasn't faced any issues yet. One star deducted for not putting the option of switching the storage location as I have to move the photos and video's manually or may be I am missing something. Overall it is an expert, competing in the market. Good work oppo.

Other then that after one month it's battery performance also going down, it can be used only up-to 7 or 8 hrs  after charging it (only in-case you are not watching any video ,not playing any game and only using internet and call or messages).

Phone software same as like iphone .utilities like cleaner , antivirus, file manager good so no need of third party apps, Apps cannot be moved to sd so , downloading heavy games is sure trouble , Music in ear decent with bundled earphone do not expect more it just entry level midsegment phone. Camera output good as display is great. Support volte 4g. Gestures control is good. Looks like premium phone as display is bright and body is metalic and in unibody form.Battery backup cant be judged in few day usage but overall battery performance is not bad. Low battery mode is sure good use. Scratch guard already there, silicon cover in box. Screen is bright but finger print magnet, it is problem only when phone is used in bright sunlight condition and display is set at low light .
  
  So overall good buy in this segment, a value for your hard earned money.

Rahul,651013614df243d59141412dbf734035,"OPPO A37f (Grey, 16 GB)",MOBEQCGVPY6GVHYT,1,All Oppo phones - not a worthy phone.,"Hi All,
  
  Have bought OppoA37 on 4th Aug which was launched a week back.
  
  Every website will talk about the prons and will not talk about the issues with the phone, even retailers. Here is what you should know before you make you decision.
  

  Cons:
  
  1) Apps can't move to SD card, which means you will have only 2GB space to use or download any applications. (This is like medieval age phone feature). You will not be able to use 16GB ROM space for your applications. Hence give a serious through about any Oppo phone. I have checked this features for all Oppo serious by visiting Oppo store.
  

  The funny thing was: Not a single counter sales man (even Oppo exclusive stores) was aware about this issue.
  
  2) UI: Although it looks good, but have many operational issues while handling the phone.
  
  a) Multi-touch action is not good: You can't delete multiple messages, Contact at a time. You need to inside every message/contact and then delete them individually.
  

  2) Phone gets heats up, even if I am on call for more than 25-30 min.
  
  3) Battery is decent, don't expect to last for more than a day. It can just last for max a day.
  
  4) Camera is decent. Not bad.
  
  5) Earphones are against not up to the standard. You may need to buy a one for better sound.
  

  Pros:
  
  1) Apple look alike phone, so you will feel good feeling while carrying this phone.
  
  2) Display is of good quality, premium looking
  
  3) Looks tough phone (too early to say anything on this, but this so far my experience)
  
  4) Camera is decent, don't expect too much from it. The pics get blurred the moment you zoom the pictures.
  

  To summarize - It's a big ""NO"" for any OPPO phones. Because:
  
  1) You will have limited space 2GB - 3GB for your App, which is too less in today technology. It's like you are going back 7-8 years in terms of technology.
  
  2) You will have many options at this price (Xiaomi Note 3 and series are very good phone - Just go for it).
  

  Yes: Only because of look and feel of the product.

Dont go into the hardselling the phone shops offer rather compare closely other phones .
  

  Battery: Terible doesnt last more then 7 hrs with whatsapp, facebook and Inshorts loaded
  
  Camera: only the one that deserves accolades
  
  Network finder: Junk P.O.S. I am surprised coz my Nokie E63 yes the old Nokia E63 performs better when it comes to network finding.
  
  HANGS!!! HANGS Just HANGS.. heats up on charging... heats up with kept in your coin box of your car...
  

  I have a prejudice against this coz I am comparing OPPO F37 with Asus Zenfone 2 Laser which not only has lesser radiation (SAR values) but a phenomenal phone with a 13 MP & 5Mp camera, a fantastic network ability, easy software, easy backup, doesnt hang up. Well priced...

  Flipkart is really good. 1st time Bought this item from a seller names as Shivanta Infotech. This is the kind of seller any customer would like to see on flipkart.
  
  Packaging was Amazingly Great by Shivanta Infotech.
  
  Delivery Time was Perfect.
  

  I would like to give full marks to Shivanta Infotech because i know behind every successful product delivery the main hand is the seller. It depends upon the seller the way it packs the products. In my case it was really neat and tidy. It was much more better even if compared to buying from a Oppo Showroom.
  

  Phone is awesome. Very easy to handle, Touch is great. I am loving it.
  

  Thanks to Flipkart and Shivanta Infoteck

Mrinmoy Roy,f28d1335868947c58a8bbbf7380b74ed,"OPPO F1s (Grey, 32 GB)",MOBEPH67A9VEF8NZ,5,It is a very good phone. (an one month usage review),"Well, to start, I didn't buy it from Flipkart as I've always preferred a physical store to buy electronics. I'm going to highlight the pros and cons after one month of usage. Before I write, I just want to mention some hard facts about review. Nowadays, almost everyone boasts of being a smartphone expert and the reviews they write are becoming increasingly bizarre and conflicting. Going through the negative reviews against this phone in this site, I found that almost all of them are just as useless and bizarre.
  
  Pros:
  
  1. Without much technological babble and theory about what being a good display and what should be a good screen and display properties, the display of this phone is very good. Yes, it is not in the same line as display of premium phones, but in the group of HD display, this display is very good and clearly visible in strong sunlight.
  
  2. Has two capacitive soft keys,not noticeable in daylight, but a soft white color that glows softly in dark.
  
  3. Has one notification LED, which is white and the glow is soft. I find it aesthetically pleasing.
  
  4. The fingerprint sensor is as it should be. Touch and unlock. It's like that. My human brain can't differentiate the tiniest lag, if any, there is in this phone while unlocking with fingerprint.
  
  5. Has a good security feature of encrypted apps. One can easily go in the settings and assign the apps with extra level of security such that when anyone will try to access that app, say whatsapp, it will ask for a pattern unlock and this pattern will be different than the pattern to unlock the phone. That is, if anyone sets a unlock pattern to unlock the phone, he can set a different pattern for these encrypted and private apps.
  
  6. There is a separate setting for designating private areas. One can set photos, videos and apps in that area and thus, making the private things safe from prying eyes. Those photos, videos or apps will not show in the phone unless explicitly viewed in the security settings with a separate unlocking pattern if set.
  
  7. I use one JIO SIM for the last two weeks, and to say truly, the result is just what is advertised by JIO makers. That is the internet speed is perfect . There is absolutely no buffering on YouTube or Dailymotion for 1080p videos.
  
  8. The video calling and voice calling features are at par with standards set and the volume on the earpiece is loud enough to hear in noisy places.
  
  9. I'm not into gaming, so can't really comment on the performance of the phone on that, but there are absolutely no heating issues to be concerned of.
  
  10. The camera is good. Please don't be concerned with someone commenting on high contrast or saturation levels in the pictures clicked by the phone or issues about not getting the full 13 or 16 megapixels from the camera. The pictures are good enough to get a good print. Although, I must say a little grain is there when pictures clicked in very low light. In medium to low light scenarios, the grains are barely noticeable and will look good in the computer screen. I cast the pictures on my 43 inch 4K TV and it looks good enough. Moreover, everybody uses one or two photo editing apps nowadays and so minor blemishes can easily be fixed. I suggest Google's Snapseed. Another thing I will like to mention to those people who are saying that they are not getting full megapixel effects in their pictures, should know that the phone makers always mention the full megapixel of their cameras subject to one condition. Most people don't know that the full megapixel in pictures can be achieved ONLY in the 4:3 aspect ratio of the pictures. If one clicks pictures with full screen mode, i.e. 16:9, the megapixels WILL always be lower.
  
  11. The phone doesn't show any lag and the app switching is smooth as butter with one left soft key dedicated for the task.
  
  12. The speaker is very good with two speaker grills at the bottom delivering stereo sounds loud enough for the purpose.
  
  13. The charging is efficient and though it doesn't say anywhere of being capable of quick charge, the charging time is decent.
  
  14. There's a power saver mode which is very effective.
  
  15. A lot of themes and fonts are available to customize the phone OS looks.
  
  16. The build quality is good and the back looks premium.
  
  17. I got a factory administered screen guard on the phone which is a little sticky on the front but at least,regular cleaning still makes it clinging to the screen with zero air bubble. Also, a transparent back cover has been provided which till date is just fine.
  
  18. Gesture controls are a draw.
  
  Cons:
  
  1. The absence of app drawer is frustrating. The default icons being on the larger size looks cluttered.
  
  2. The default music player is not good and for that I will suggest a good music player app to be downloaded from GP.
  
  3. Doesn't run Marshmallow. So forget about Nougat for now.
  
  4. The charging adapter unit is bulky.
  
  I suggest to go for this phone.

KEDARSAI,791fc7efeee4451b9f0b41bb801cc3bb,"OPPO F1s (Grey, 32 GB)",MOBEPH67A9VEF8NZ,4,Decent mobile with stunning looks,"Buy it you wont regret it.
  
  pros:-
  
  1. Stunning looks with good looking OS-->(10/10)
  
  2.Good camera (better for selfies ) it has front flash screen flash like iphone 6s-->(8/10) -2 points less for lack of low light performance)
  
  3.Good call connectivity-->(10/10)
  
  4.Screen quality is good even it is 720p-->(8/10)
  
  5.Processor is well optimized for performance.-->(9/10)
  
  6.Sound output is very good(speakers)-->(9/10)
  
  7.Finger print is blazing fast-->(10/10)
  
  8.Color OS features are very useful
  
  9.Battery life is good , it last minimum a day even on heavy usage
  
  10. No heating issues.  No lags.
  
  11.Screen protector and case are provided in box.
  

  CONS:- The only con i observed is lack of fast charging it usually takes 2.5 to 3 hrs for full charge.  you can charge it at early morning and it last a day easily.
  

  looks similar to iphone 6s+ even OS looks like IOS some may feel it as copy, but phone looks nice and performance is fluid.

The negative reviews doesn't has con authentic problem which is purely about the phone. Someone's inserting some corrupt memory cards, someone says poor Internet speed, some said battery draining fast. But honestly I didn't face any of the above mentioned issues, been using this for almost one month. Using 24/7. Watching movies, calling, video calling, taking selfies, doing everything y.at a smart phone can do. After doing all this, I declare the phone is to good.
  
  Someone was talking about poor build quality, it's all metal. What else you want. Build quality is awesome.

Mrinmoy Roy,f28d1335868947c58a8bbbf7380b74ed,"OPPO F1s (Gold, 32 GB)",MOBEHCWECYGB3EF7,5,It is a very good phone. (an one month usage review),"Well, to start, I didn't buy it from Flipkart as I've always preferred a physical store to buy electronics. I'm going to highlight the pros and cons after one month of usage. Before I write, I just want to mention some hard facts about review. Nowadays, almost everyone boasts of being a smartphone expert and the reviews they write are becoming increasingly bizarre and conflicting. Going through the negative reviews against this phone in this site, I found that almost all of them are just as useless and bizarre.
  
  Pros:
  
  1. Without much technological babble and theory about what being a good display and what should be a good screen and display properties, the display of this phone is very good. Yes, it is not in the same line as display of premium phones, but in the group of HD display, this display is very good and clearly visible in strong sunlight.
  
  2. Has two capacitive soft keys,not noticeable in daylight, but a soft white color that glows softly in dark.
  
  3. Has one notification LED, which is white and the glow is soft. I find it aesthetically pleasing.
  
  4. The fingerprint sensor is as it should be. Touch and unlock. It's like that. My human brain can't differentiate the tiniest lag, if any, there is in this phone while unlocking with fingerprint.
  
  5. Has a good security feature of encrypted apps. One can easily go in the settings and assign the apps with extra level of security such that when anyone will try to access that app, say whatsapp, it will ask for a pattern unlock and this pattern will be different than the pattern to unlock the phone. That is, if anyone sets a unlock pattern to unlock the phone, he can set a different pattern for these encrypted and private apps.
  
  6. There is a separate setting for designating private areas. One can set photos, videos and apps in that area and thus, making the private things safe from prying eyes. Those photos, videos or apps will not show in the phone unless explicitly viewed in the security settings with a separate unlocking pattern if set.
  
  7. I use one JIO SIM for the last two weeks, and to say truly, the result is just what is advertised by JIO makers. That is the internet speed is perfect . There is absolutely no buffering on YouTube or Dailymotion for 1080p videos.
  
  8. The video calling and voice calling features are at par with standards set and the volume on the earpiece is loud enough to hear in noisy places.
  
  9. I'm not into gaming, so can't really comment on the performance of the phone on that, but there are absolutely no heating issues to be concerned of.
  
  10. The camera is good. Please don't be concerned with someone commenting on high contrast or saturation levels in the pictures clicked by the phone or issues about not getting the full 13 or 16 megapixels from the camera. The pictures are good enough to get a good print. Although, I must say a little grain is there when pictures clicked in very low light. In medium to low light scenarios, the grains are barely noticeable and will look good in the computer screen. I cast the pictures on my 43 inch 4K TV and it looks good enough. Moreover, everybody uses one or two photo editing apps nowadays and so minor blemishes can easily be fixed. I suggest Google's Snapseed. Another thing I will like to mention to those people who are saying that they are not getting full megapixel effects in their pictures, should know that the phone makers always mention the full megapixel of their cameras subject to one condition. Most people don't know that the full megapixel in pictures can be achieved ONLY in the 4:3 aspect ratio of the pictures. If one clicks pictures with full screen mode, i.e. 16:9, the megapixels WILL always be lower.
  
  11. The phone doesn't show any lag and the app switching is smooth as butter with one left soft key dedicated for the task.
  
  12. The speaker is very good with two speaker grills at the bottom delivering stereo sounds loud enough for the purpose.
  
  13. The charging is efficient and though it doesn't say anywhere of being capable of quick charge, the charging time is decent.
  
  14. There's a power saver mode which is very effective.
  
  15. A lot of themes and fonts are available to customize the phone OS looks.
  
  16. The build quality is good and the back looks premium.
  
  17. I got a factory administered screen guard on the phone which is a little sticky on the front but at least,regular cleaning still makes it clinging to the screen with zero air bubble. Also, a transparent back cover has been provided which till date is just fine.
  
  18. Gesture controls are a draw.
  
  Cons:
  
  1. The absence of app drawer is frustrating. The default icons being on the larger size looks cluttered.
  
  2. The default music player is not good and for that I will suggest a good music player app to be downloaded from GP.
  
  3. Doesn't run Marshmallow. So forget about Nougat for now.
  
  4. The charging adapter unit is bulky.
  
  I suggest to go for this phone.

  looks similar to iphone 6s+ even OS looks like IOS some may feel it as copy, but phone looks nice and performance is fluid.

  I purchased Oppo F1s few days back, and got to know through TV add the upgraded version is going to out.  It is very disappointing to me cause I save money to buy best phone. I am Samsung user and planning to go with latest specs with 4GB ram. I choose Lenovo but with the best market review I opted Oppo F1s.
  

  My budget was upto 20K and hence I took 18K oppo F1s. It really disappointed to me when I get to know the upgraded version going to available as I can wait if I seen this add before purchasing.. Seriously I'm budget person but gadget lover..
  

  My request Oppo to please provide me an upgraded version of F1s.
  

  In other hand using mobile is good.  No gang or heating issue...  The only cons. Is ram balance show below 800mb means system use more than 2GB of total 3GB ram.
  

  This also cause I request upgraded version.

  2 stars for camera and hybrid sim slot, u can insert both 2 sim and sd card in this.camera is good but there are noises in picture. No other special feature. Battery backup is okay but its charger is too slow to charge, not a fast charger , i use Motorola's turbo charger to charge this phone. Sometimes it freezes and lags but not too much. If u r willing to buy this phone, instead of buying this phone here take a look at your nearest mobile store

  PROS- front and back camera...just superb,
  
  - superb metal body built quality and design premium look
  
  - corning gorilla glass 4 protection and 2.5d arc Curved display
  
  - good ram and internal memory..smooth               experience with heavy games like ashpalt nitro    shadow fight 2 candy crush subway surfer
  
  - good color os ui, smart on and specially off screen gesture controls and smart call features are really very good and makes it relly easy to use
  

  CONS- display tends to slightly fed away in outdoor bright sun light, but can be managed by incresing the screen brightness
  
  - heating issue...but only sometimes...in my usage of 5 and half months it got heat up only 2-3 times

Rear camera is very poor. Its not upto the mark as compared to any mobile ranging in 16K. So be at front of mobile to look good, back camera may disappoint you.
  
  Other functions are moderate.

  Pros
  
  - good build and finish. Light weight
  
  - accessories included like ear phones, scratch guard, decent back cover that is not slippery
  
  - I prefer this size since it is easy for one hand operation
  
  - screen clarity is good both indoor and outdoor
  
  - good response with the 3 GB RAM. I've not installed too many apps though. No issue of hanging so far
  
  - battery life is not bad. I am able to use it for a day and a half with wifi used most of the time. Able to charge from 30% to 100% in around 1 hr
  
  - no heating issue so far
  

  Cons
  
  - can't use the memory slot if you are using dual sim.
  
  - not very happy with ease of using the keypad, especially for dialing from phone book. Have to click twice to dial. Don't know if this is an OS issue
  

  Final comments
  
  Overall great value for money. I would definitely recommend this if your budget is 15 to 20k.

Yes the rear camera was not good initially but after the update its working great.Those who are still complaing about the rear camera should not have updated their phone. And better compare the camera with other phones in this price range and you will know the difference.
  
  Yes there is a battery problem but you cannot expect a battery of 2600 power to work hole day and nightafter continuos use. Also it takes a lot time to charge.
  
  Next is the primary camera which is very good.
  
  The phone processing is amazing and handles heavy games without a lag.
  
  Out of 3 GB ram you get approx 1.8 which is awsome for multitasking.
  
  The screen is protected with Gorilla Glass 4 and so you don't need any further screen protection.Is easy to handle and is very light .
  

  Overall the phone's performance is amazingly good.

Performance of the phone is good i.e. it doesn't hang while using apps or doesn't get heated even when you talk for 30-40 minutes. However the internal memory is biggest issue. U get only 1 gb internal storage and it gets exhausted very fast and then u cant update important apps. When I spoke to customer care, they said update will be released in Nov and it will resolve the issue but till 6th December, no update is received. So if u want to buy a phone, buy one which has minimum 8 gb ROM or which allows u to save apps on SD card directly. This phone lacks both.

  I am using the phone since 10 days and really enjoying. Some guys are saying the phone is costly but it is really worth money. Its a premium phone for which you would cost around 30k to 40k for other popular make.
  
  Some say Hybrid 2nd SIM is a problem. You either use 2nd sim or SD card. But 64GB Rom provides you enough space so no need to have SD card.
  

  pros:
  
  Camera: Selfie camera is awesome. I tested the rear camera in low light as well and it is also clicking good photos.
  
  Battery: I liked the fast charging. Within 50 minutes 100% battery get charged. Though its only 2750mh, it last for a day easily with descent working on phone.
  
  Processor & RAM: Fast and smooth operation, never lagged so far.
  
  Color OS: Very refreshing. Got 2 updates in 10 days period.
  
  Ultra slim: I opted this phone mainly for its thinness. Its light and just 6.6mm thin.
  
  Warranty: 2 years. no one provides 2 years warranty.
  
  64 GB ROM: Another reason i purchase this phone for. Really fade up of old phone of having only 8GB internal memory.
  
  The phone does not come with too much freeloaded APPs.  That is big relief as you need root the phone to uninstall the bulky apps.
  


  Cons:
  
  1. Specs mentions displays has corning gorilla glass 4, but i doubt as my phone has got scratches. Putting the scratch guard on.
  

  So guys if you have 26K budget, go grab this phone without any doubt.

  Battery life 8 points
  
  Camera 8 points
  
  Value for money 7 points
  
  Overall I'll give 7 points to this device
  

  Here's my conclusion
  

  Oppo has created yet another good-looking smartphone with the F1 Plus. Yes, the new hardware and software look very much like Apple's iPhone and iOS, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There are people out there who would love to own an iPhone but don't have the means to do so, and it's smartphones like this that help fill the void. At Rs. 26,990 the F1 Plus is certainly a lot more affordable than an iPhone 6 as well.
  

  That resemblance aside, the F1 Plus is beautifully crafted and extremely well built. It's slim and light weight, has a super-fast fingerprint sensor, vibrant display, good battery life and two very good cameras for daylight photography. Like any tech product however, there's always room for improvement. For instance, the screen's viewing angles aren't the best, and it takes on a bluish tinge if you veer too far from the sweet spot. We would also have liked better connectivity features too such as NFC and Wi-Fi ac. Also, despite the large 16-megapixel selfie camera, it doesn't fare terribly well in low-light situations. The screen flash is nice touch but it's no substitute for an LED flash, especially if you're taking a group selfie.
  

  Overall, the F1 Plus is good smartphone that would be even better at a lower price considering its limitations.

Only one area of concern is it's mediatek  processor which is relatively slow when compared to other modern day Snapdragon or exynos  processor.  Games  support good ( high quality)  but not one of the best for gaming!  One plus 3 ahead in performance compared to oppo!
  

  I would still say it's a best phone in market! Thanks to oppo!

  Performance wise mind blowing 4GB RAM what else you need with 64 GB ROM.Store whatever you want.
  

  The touch sensor at its best,the algorithms inside it do their job perfectly,within fraction of seconds phone unlocks by finger touch sensor.
  

  Color OS is one of new interface Oppo introduced in this flagship phone,you feel really new while using it.Camera is again an outstanding as far as photo shoots are concern,very cleverly did its selfie jobs by 16MP front camera,rear too with 13MP gave wonderful picture clarity.

You will love everything about this phone. Great looks with awesome camera. Phone is very slim and light weight. Only thing that bothers me a lil is battery life. It last one day. So that is enough. More over, it takes approx Max of 1 hour to charge from 10 to 100%. Awesome.
  
  1. Camera - 10/10 Both front and back cam.
  
  2. Lookwise - 10/10
  
  3. Fast Charging-10/10
  
  4. Super Fast phone- you will never see any lag.
  
  5. Approx 53 GB memory will be available for user and around ~2 GB Ram will always be free from total of 4 GB Ram.
  
  6. Both sim slots works great. Hybrid 2nd sim can be used for memory card slot and it works nice as well.
  
  7. Finger print is soo fast that no one will notice u unlocking it ;) It unlocks phone so fast.
  
  8. 2 year Oppo warrenty
  

  Overall it is a great phone worth buy. If your budget is 25K, go for it, Dont think much :)

Even we can able to handle this 5.5 inch as handy. Am using while travelling I will switch on music, internet, hot-spot, and gaming simultaneously but it won't hang nearly 1gb Ram is still free after that. It's simply awesome. And next is battery level is just 2800mah.  But In travelling we no need any power bank.  Because it nearly stands for a day while using 24hrs fully. And moreover Slim body,  sexy color, and one more is camera. It's marvellous amazing front 16mp and back 13mp but related both are quiet similar. And OTG IS compatible with this and nearly 53gb of memory for user data. Ram is the advantage.
  

  Disadvantage is very high end games gives heat to mobile using the game more than 1hr then it will your hands hurt.

  After using oppo f1 plus (rose gold) for 7 months i m writing dis review... I hav bought dis phn from a local store. Bt i dont know wht to say, actually i m speechless... Honestly speaking dis phone was not my 1st choice at that time bt now i cant think abt anything bt this...
  
  Okk... Lets start with it.....
  

  PROS------......
  

  1. Battary backup is superb, normaly i spend 5hrs on dis phn daily playing some heavy games like fifa16, NFS most wanted. And also do some vdo calling... And while taking voice call i always surf net or play games.. Bt still i just have to charge dis phn only once in a day.
  

  2. 4gb RAM is really fast... Nothing to say abt it.. In this 7months my phn never hanged not even once.. And u knw how heavily i use dis phn.
  

  3. Camera... Rear 13mp really good. Better than htc , samsung , apple and VIVO...
  
  Front 16mp, man nothing to say abt it. I hav sold my digi cam after seeing this camera. Just 2words Crystal Clear...
  

  4. Design- honestly speaking if u hold dis phn u will feel like u r holding i-phone 7... So slick. So sexy...
  

  5. Display is also good.. Its amoled.
  

  6. Sound- Smooth, clear. Headphone quality is also good.
  

  7. Others- fingerprint sensor is superb, it also has vox charger means from 20% -100% in less than 30 mins. Storage is 64gb so no need for sd card. It has gorrila glass4 so do some rough use it doesnt matter...
  

  CONS-----.....
  

  1. Sorry sorry sorry...
  
  In 7 months i didnt find any..... If i found anythng i will let u knw... Bt for that i bliv i hat to wait for 2-3years may b or more...

  Camera quality : Perfect in day light,  both front and rear are amazing. But it gets poor in low light conditions.
  
  I am facing some downloading issues,  downloading files get closed automatically as the device goes locked.
  
  Rest others features are good including battery life.  Battery gets charged very quickly.
  
  Fingerprint sensor and the design/metal build of phone is just unbeatable.

  Apart from camera the speakers are also brilliant. Sometimes it lags in running some high quality game but works well with low graphic games.
  
  But the place where it lags is to run 4-G on it you have to go to the store to upgrade it that really sucks.
  
  Apart from all the thing Oppo is doing really and if they improve certain things it will surely emerge as a big company.

Flipkart Customer,fcf1d98ef58b4ce8aded365ca4641cc0,"OPPO Neo 7 4G (Black, 16 GB)",MOBEDFHCGBZHJ3AK,3,Good but nothing fancy,"First off all, it IS a nice phone.
  
  Pros:
  
  Nice camera
  
  Very very nice colour os
  
  Cons:
  
  Avg battery backup
  
  Not full hd
  
  Only 1 gb ram.,I experienced hang on my first day itself. But since CPU is a powerful one high end games don't lag.
  
  Giving it only 3 stars coz of the qhd  display and 1 gb ram.
  
  If u want a phone with bttr battery backup and ram go for Lenovo vibe p1 m... I was planning to buy Lenovo but eventually bought this... Disappointed with 1 gb ram..

  It was very good phone at this price..
  
  Who want go for buy apple phone is a dream, or in thought to use a branded phone just go for it, without any thinking...
  
  It's awesome mobile...
  
  If you keep in hand, you feel very proud to show the mobile to others...
  
  It's a LITTLE BROTHER OF APPLE....
  
  Pro's: - 1) battery is 2420 mah but it will have for two days ... What ever you want to use you can use it...
  
  2) superb gusters no other branded mobile gaves..
  
  3) speakers output tooo good ... Music sounding very nice...
  
  4)I wann a tell first is this both the cameras are no doubt at all...It's like 13mp back  and 8 mp front but 8 and 5mp given... Very nice cameras...
  
  Con's:- I didn't find any con's in it...  before I used Panasonic, honor, mi, gienee Microsoft leetv, no mobile can give this satisfaction...
  
  Finally today i'm going to review this product. Because at morning 6:30 am I wakeup battery was about to 24% now tha time is 12: 17 am (night) charge is about to 2% ...
  
  How much great battery backup you can assume....  that's the specialty of OPPO the brand....

  1.camera quality is good and u can have good selfies.
  
  2.hanging problem exists due to low ram(only 1 gb) specially while multitasking.
  
  3.battery drains fast. Really poor battery backup. U need to carry a power bank with u even if u r a moderate user.
  
  4.heating issue on 1st update and even after dat i found sometimes.

But if you are buying this phone for anything else like gaming or for internet surfing this phone is not suggested. 1gb Ram is a bit mistake by oppo.
  
  You should go for Mi 3s(Nat option for gaming), Moto g4(best option for camera phone and normal use)Le 1s is is better than Oppo Neo 7 but but you can also buy MI Note 3 and 2 Samsung J series if you go above 10000.

  PROS- front and back camera...just superb,
  
  - superb metal body built quality and design premium look
  
  - corning gorilla glass 4 protection and 2.5d arc Curved display
  
  - good ram and internal memory..smooth               experience with heavy games like ashpalt nitro    shadow fight 2 candy crush subway surfer
  
  - good color os ui, smart on and specially off screen gesture controls and smart call features are really very good and makes it relly easy to use
  

  CONS- display tends to slightly fed away in outdoor bright sun light, but can be managed by incresing the screen brightness
  
  - heating issue...but only sometimes...in my usage of 5 and half months it got heat up only 2-3 times

  Pros
  
  - good build and finish. Light weight
  
  - accessories included like ear phones, scratch guard, decent back cover that is not slippery
  
  - I prefer this size since it is easy for one hand operation
  
  - screen clarity is good both indoor and outdoor
  
  - good response with the 3 GB RAM. I've not installed too many apps though. No issue of hanging so far
  
  - battery life is not bad. I am able to use it for a day and a half with wifi used most of the time. Able to charge from 30% to 100% in around 1 hr
  
  - no heating issue so far
  

  Cons
  
  - can't use the memory slot if you are using dual sim.
  
  - not very happy with ease of using the keypad, especially for dialing from phone book. Have to click twice to dial. Don't know if this is an OS issue
  

  Final comments
  
  Overall great value for money. I would definitely recommend this if your budget is 15 to 20k.

Yes the rear camera was not good initially but after the update its working great.Those who are still complaing about the rear camera should not have updated their phone. And better compare the camera with other phones in this price range and you will know the difference.
  
  Yes there is a battery problem but you cannot expect a battery of 2600 power to work hole day and nightafter continuos use. Also it takes a lot time to charge.
  
  Next is the primary camera which is very good.
  
  The phone processing is amazing and handles heavy games without a lag.
  
  Out of 3 GB ram you get approx 1.8 which is awsome for multitasking.
  
  The screen is protected with Gorilla Glass 4 and so you don't need any further screen protection.Is easy to handle and is very light .
  

  Overall the phone's performance is amazingly good.

  Please don't blame OPPO as a brand to market this product in India, they are just doing their Job. It's not really your fault, if you'll would've known the story behind this model from Oppo you'll would've symphathized with the Company and Bought it.
  

  The Real Story was the OPPO Engineers put together days and nights and they went to every electronic dumping station and recovered all the long thrown away pieces of the 2008's and 2009's.
  

  They then handpicked each piece and consereved it. The refurbished each piece and re-branded it and made all of its amazing features work, like a 3.0 Megapixel Camera or a 512MB RAM. Some of the engineer's were so dedicated that they even contributed to giving away a part of thier phone's RAM into some 2008 256 RAM Models. With additional Features such as a Basic 480 X 800 pixel 4-inch screen and 4GB internal storage their mission was accomplished to make the Ultimate phone for a Plague Stricken and Bankrupt Country in Africa.
  

  They knew that the poverty and backwardness in those country's hasn't attracted to many Global Giants of Technology. They were also sure that since the Countries in Africa are at least 50 years behind the rest, they could easily sell a product of the 2008's - 2009's. This was their Eureka Moment. So they set out to be the Great Pioneer's of Cell Phones in Africa, just like how Nokia once was to India, OPPO would be to Africa!! With this endeavoring mission they started packing and shipping their lot of OPPO Joy R1001.
  

  So when the Shipment of the handsets was on its way, the company was informed of the notorious Ebola Virus which was spreading like wildfire. Hence to ensure the safety of their employees, they halted their ship at the nearest port, in India. So days passed and their stock was ready but not sold. The company started going into losses, that's when the head honcho's at OPPO panicked.
  

  In the mean time one of their employee, who was exploring the port city of Mumbai happened to roam at Kharghar, in Navi Mumbai. There he noticed that there was a niche market for their product to Nigerians and Other People from the African country who resided there as Students. The employee then thought of an Idea which would tarnish OPPO's image in India forever. He decided to requested the OPPO heads to allow him to utilize this OPPOrtunity and start advertising and selling these Phones in Mumbai.
  

  And since then The Employee has never looked Back.... Cause HE WAS FIRED!!

And they are selling it for seven and half thousand, I initially thought that this phone would be at least comparable to XonPhone or ZTE or Huawei, if not Xiaomi redmi.  What do they think of us Indians, fools?  If this phone is any indicator, then xiaomi should sell for fifty thousand rupees.  An advise to Flipkart; throw these phones in a dustbin and ask OPPO to retrieve them to sell in China.

  Now in today's mobile market everyday a new mobile is coming with great features in moderate price.
  
  Apple iphone 6 cost Rs 53000 does not mean that oppo deserve Rs 7990 with such specification.
  
  If any new manufacturer want to sell mobile it has to loaded with features on lower prices so that Customer are attracted first.
  
  Look what Redmi has done, though it may have heating issues but who will assure that this will not have the same issue,  Because after all nobody will buy it.

  I am using the phone since 10 days and really enjoying. Some guys are saying the phone is costly but it is really worth money. Its a premium phone for which you would cost around 30k to 40k for other popular make.
  
  Some say Hybrid 2nd SIM is a problem. You either use 2nd sim or SD card. But 64GB Rom provides you enough space so no need to have SD card.
  

  pros:
  
  Camera: Selfie camera is awesome. I tested the rear camera in low light as well and it is also clicking good photos.
  
  Battery: I liked the fast charging. Within 50 minutes 100% battery get charged. Though its only 2750mh, it last for a day easily with descent working on phone.
  
  Processor & RAM: Fast and smooth operation, never lagged so far.
  
  Color OS: Very refreshing. Got 2 updates in 10 days period.
  
  Ultra slim: I opted this phone mainly for its thinness. Its light and just 6.6mm thin.
  
  Warranty: 2 years. no one provides 2 years warranty.
  
  64 GB ROM: Another reason i purchase this phone for. Really fade up of old phone of having only 8GB internal memory.
  
  The phone does not come with too much freeloaded APPs.  That is big relief as you need root the phone to uninstall the bulky apps.
  


  Cons:
  
  1. Specs mentions displays has corning gorilla glass 4, but i doubt as my phone has got scratches. Putting the scratch guard on.
  

  So guys if you have 26K budget, go grab this phone without any doubt.

  Performance 8 points
  
  Battery life 8 points
  
  Camera 8 points
  
  Value for money 7 points
  
  Overall I'll give 7 points to this device
  

  Here's my conclusion
  

  Oppo has created yet another good-looking smartphone with the F1 Plus. Yes, the new hardware and software look very much like Apple's iPhone and iOS, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There are people out there who would love to own an iPhone but don't have the means to do so, and it's smartphones like this that help fill the void. At Rs. 26,990 the F1 Plus is certainly a lot more affordable than an iPhone 6 as well.
  

  That resemblance aside, the F1 Plus is beautifully crafted and extremely well built. It's slim and light weight, has a super-fast fingerprint sensor, vibrant display, good battery life and two very good cameras for daylight photography. Like any tech product however, there's always room for improvement. For instance, the screen's viewing angles aren't the best, and it takes on a bluish tinge if you veer too far from the sweet spot. We would also have liked better connectivity features too such as NFC and Wi-Fi ac. Also, despite the large 16-megapixel selfie camera, it doesn't fare terribly well in low-light situations. The screen flash is nice touch but it's no substitute for an LED flash, especially if you're taking a group selfie.
  

  Overall, the F1 Plus is good smartphone that would be even better at a lower price considering its limitations.

Only one area of concern is it's mediatek  processor which is relatively slow when compared to other modern day Snapdragon or exynos  processor.  Games  support good ( high quality)  but not one of the best for gaming!  One plus 3 ahead in performance compared to oppo!
  

  I would still say it's a best phone in market! Thanks to oppo!

  Performance wise mind blowing 4GB RAM what else you need with 64 GB ROM.Store whatever you want.
  

  The touch sensor at its best,the algorithms inside it do their job perfectly,within fraction of seconds phone unlocks by finger touch sensor.
  

  Color OS is one of new interface Oppo introduced in this flagship phone,you feel really new while using it.Camera is again an outstanding as far as photo shoots are concern,very cleverly did its selfie jobs by 16MP front camera,rear too with 13MP gave wonderful picture clarity.
  

  Just try once.

You will love everything about this phone. Great looks with awesome camera. Phone is very slim and light weight. Only thing that bothers me a lil is battery life. It last one day. So that is enough. More over, it takes approx Max of 1 hour to charge from 10 to 100%. Awesome.
  
  1. Camera - 10/10 Both front and back cam.
  
  2. Lookwise - 10/10
  
  3. Fast Charging-10/10
  
  4. Super Fast phone- you will never see any lag.
  
  5. Approx 53 GB memory will be available for user and around ~2 GB Ram will always be free from total of 4 GB Ram.
  
  6. Both sim slots works great. Hybrid 2nd sim can be used for memory card slot and it works nice as well.
  
  7. Finger print is soo fast that no one will notice u unlocking it ;) It unlocks phone so fast.
  
  8. 2 year Oppo warrenty
  

  Overall it is a great phone worth buy. If your budget is 25K, go for it, Dont think much :)

Even we can able to handle this 5.5 inch as handy. Am using while travelling I will switch on music, internet, hot-spot, and gaming simultaneously but it won't hang nearly 1gb Ram is still free after that. It's simply awesome. And next is battery level is just 2800mah.  But In travelling we no need any power bank.  Because it nearly stands for a day while using 24hrs fully. And moreover Slim body,  sexy color, and one more is camera. It's marvellous amazing front 16mp and back 13mp but related both are quiet similar. And OTG IS compatible with this and nearly 53gb of memory for user data. Ram is the advantage.
  

  Disadvantage is very high end games gives heat to mobile using the game more than 1hr then it will your hands hurt.
  

  Thanks for the product.
  

  OPPO SUPER THATS IT.

  After using oppo f1 plus (rose gold) for 7 months i m writing dis review... I hav bought dis phn from a local store. Bt i dont know wht to say, actually i m speechless... Honestly speaking dis phone was not my 1st choice at that time bt now i cant think abt anything bt this...
  
  Okk... Lets start with it.....
  

  PROS------......
  

  1. Battary backup is superb, normaly i spend 5hrs on dis phn daily playing some heavy games like fifa16, NFS most wanted. And also do some vdo calling... And while taking voice call i always surf net or play games.. Bt still i just have to charge dis phn only once in a day.
  

  2. 4gb RAM is really fast... Nothing to say abt it.. In this 7months my phn never hanged not even once.. And u knw how heavily i use dis phn.
  

  3. Camera... Rear 13mp really good. Better than htc , samsung , apple and VIVO...
  
  Front 16mp, man nothing to say abt it. I hav sold my digi cam after seeing this camera. Just 2words Crystal Clear...
  

  4. Design- honestly speaking if u hold dis phn u will feel like u r holding i-phone 7... So slick. So sexy...
  

  5. Display is also good.. Its amoled.
  

  6. Sound- Smooth, clear. Headphone quality is also good.
  

  7. Others- fingerprint sensor is superb, it also has vox charger means from 20% -100% in less than 30 mins. Storage is 64gb so no need for sd card. It has gorrila glass4 so do some rough use it doesnt matter...
  

  CONS-----.....
  

  1. Sorry sorry sorry...
  
  In 7 months i didnt find any..... If i found anythng i will let u knw... Bt for that i bliv i hat to wait for 2-3years may b or more...

  There also notification light at the right corner oof phone (left side of us).. Its should be enabled from settings..
  
  Then coming to android oppo mobile are entirely different with color os features..
  
  Before using it dont argue with its price.. Less weight and so tiny mobile.. Easy to handle.. And many more gesture motions available..

  Camera quality : Perfect in day light,  both front and rear are amazing. But it gets poor in low light conditions.
  
  I am facing some downloading issues,  downloading files get closed automatically as the device goes locked.
  
  Rest others features are good including battery life.  Battery gets charged very quickly.
  
  Fingerprint sensor and the design/metal build of phone is just unbeatable.
  
  And there is no heating issues.

Overall the phone is awesome I will put in a detailed review. First of all pros : very fast charging charges in about 40 to 45 minutes, front camera is excellent , screen resolution is excellent, now the cons: the back camera is not that great as it should be it does not look like 13 megapixels when you try to zoom it blurs.. and the worst part which I have found is that the back camera flash is not a dual LED flash it's only a single LED flash which is slightly yellowish in colour show the picture quality is not great in low light conditions. And the video recording is also average if you ignore these small points then otherwise the phone is brilliant.

  Otherwise the phone does not lag at all after using 50gb of the internal memory and 23 Gb of a 32 gb memcard. Charging is ultra fast. Camera is superb and quick. Tired gaming as well although i'm not an avid gamer, but its good.
  
  Only things is that there is a slight delay with the push notifications.

  Oppo advertise this as camera phone.. but for camera i give it 4/10. Both front & back cam are poor .. i feel that these chinese phones doesn't take good pictures, they are jst trying to beautify pics by adjusting brightness etc. But when u zoom the picture u will see the blurr.. i am giving this review cus i wanted a very camera specific phone.. unhappy with It's camera.. i compare it with samgung grand max .. if i give grand max 7/10 then i give 4/10 to oppo. Very -very poor for camera..

  I have used Iphone 6,Lenovo vibe shot,Lumia 820,Samsung galaxy note edge and by far its way better a phone than these.Oppo lacks in promotional policies,and web designing is pathetic for them,with a chinese tag attached to it,makes people hard to believe what it is worthy of.Brilliant fingerprint recognisation,amazing fast charging(It charges 2-3% in every single minute),huge 4 GB RAM,wonderful maltitasking with no gaming lag,good speakers(I won't say brilliant,but it's good),absolute zero heating issues and last but not least awesome,and I mean awesome, network adaptability.

  Pros:
  
  1. The builds quality seems to be very good.
  

  2. I was earlier using galaxy S4. The battery backup is better than S4.
  

  3. The display of mobile is stunning.
  

  4. Call quality and network reception are very good.
  

  5. The internet performance is much better than galaxy S4,  I was earlier using.
  

  6. Battery charging is extremely fast (the feature I like the most).
  

  7. The speakers are really loud.
  

  8. As far as specs are concerned, the only competitor is Lg G3 (priced at whopping 48000/-).
  

  9. My Antutu benchmark score is 42999, next to only HTC M8. Galaxy S5, Lg G3 are all behind it.
  

  10. Color OS is very stable and UI looks better than that of samsung Touchwiz ui.
  

  Cons:
  
  1. The price is bit high ( But seems reasonable with these specs).
  

  2. There is some play (gap w.r.t. body) in physical buttons I.e. power and volume buttons. The samsung devices physical buttons have nearly zero play.
  

  3. No service centres.
  

  4. Camera is good but not best.
  

  5. Android version is 4.3.
  

  6. Official accessories are not available.

It got the super display that is QHD which is comparatively better than my friends LG G3. So i have saved my money by buying OPPO Find 7 instead of spending 50 K on LG G3.
  
  Camera quality is awesome i think those who say the camera is not good... i think they haven't used this phone..it is far better then any of the 13MP/16MP/20MP camera smartphones available in the market. The most amazing thing is the front 5MP camera that has BIS sensor which gives you best selfie experience as compare to S5/LG G3/Sony Z2 smartphone. Another it has 4-times faster charging technology which is awesome for a smartphone.. which makes me feel different from other who look for charging their smartphones every-time...Seriously so many unique features and with a great jade black look...this smartphone worth buying for me.Best Technology in such a good price .. i think i should thanks OPPO for pricing it below 40K instead of others brand who are selling craps for 50k.

  I needed an extremely fast camera, which the Sony camera sensor satisfies completely. 4K recording is something that will be a norm very soon. We are already seeing 4K tv's available. The specs are impressive
  

  1] Quad HD screen 2] 4K recording 3] 4G 4] Ultra fast charging.

  For a great phone to live with and be excited to hold and use everyday, look no further. Having used a lot of other phones in the market. I can confidently say that no other phone comes close to providing such a rich and personalized experience as the OPPO Find 7 X9076.

  Also, it is capable of recording videos at 4K resolution and slow motion. In 'Ultra HD' mode, the camera clicks ten photos at the backend and weaves them together into a 50 MP photo perfect for high quality prints.
  
  The next USP is touch response time,its even smoother and accurate than iPhone 5s which had the best touch screen until now.
  
  Good battery backup
  
  Great Display quality
  
  Doesn't gets heated up too much like other phones

  Let me start this review by stating that Oppo is one of the few brands which provide warranty to their devices even after you ROOT it or install custom ROMs, your warranty doesn't void.
  

  Moving on to the OS of this device, it runs on out of the box Android JellyBean 4.3 WHICH is up-gradable to KitKat 4.4.2 Till today. There're also custom ROMs running Android Lollipop 5.0.1+ and will continue to get Latest android versions till >5 years. As its a flagship device, It'll get official builds of popular custom ROMs like CyanogenMOD/MIUI.
  

  When it comes to hardware, this baby is made of Ti-Al Body frame. I've myself dropped the phone a dozen times on road concrete and not even a single dent or scratch has appeared (Watch the Oppo R5 toughness video published by the company itself, they both have the same build material). The stereo speakers are very crisp and loud, even beats the HTC M8 in loudness comparison(Bass). The carbon-fiber back and skyline notification easily catches one's attention.
  

  Now coming to the price. I find this phone worth every rupee spent on it ( Especially because it doesn't void my warranty on installing ROMs and ROOTING). You won't regret buying it!

If you are still wondering, OPPO was the first phone to come with 1080p display and now with Find 7 , Oppo has become the first company to give you a phone with 4*720p i.e Quad HD display.
  

  Looks: If you got a One plus One people will find it hard to differentiate between the two phones. But still this is a strongly built poly-carbonate phone with the screen occupying the whole of front instead of plastic. The phone will be a lot bigger of course as it has a 5.5 inch display and will surely take more than one hand to operate.
  

  Power: The phone runs on a new not newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor that gives you a clock speed of 2.5 Ghz. The speed is fantastic and coupled with 330 GPU playing games will be butter smooth. the 3 GB RAM helps to run multiple applications without any lag.
  

  Camera. No it is not 50 Megapixels. It has a wonderful 13 MPx camera that has an Ultra HDR option that wil help you combine multiple pictures which will give you a resolution equal to a lens that takes 50Mpx images.
  

  Price: If you compare this to other vendors in the market, this is the cheapest QHD phone available in the world. At nearly 38000 bucks this is not cheap at all, but neither is LG G3 and Korean specific Samsung LTE.
  

  Wrap up- Except the software point of view, the phone is a killer. The phone runs on android 4.3 colour OS of Oppo that has got some wonderful gestures . If you want to look different and feel different go for this phone, if QHD is not a big deal there is still OPPO 7a for you minus the QHD.

  Now that Gionee and Xiaomi have somewhat established themselves as good Chinese brands, OPPO needs to compete with them rather than Samsung/Apple/LG/HTC.
  
  Needless to say at this price, OPPO is neither here nor there as they say in hindi....na ghar ka na ghat ka.....

  Revise the pricing or launch a medium priced one, establish the brand and then launch a premium phone.
  

  Who ever buys this mobile should be truly desperate to get rid of their money!!

  Review by GSMArena:
  

  Here's a list of our other key test findings for the Oppo Find 7:
  
   Build quality is great, but the navigation buttons are uncomfortably dim
  
   The display is very crisp and with ultra-wide viewing angles, and has decent contrast. It's not too great when it comes to sunlight legibility, however.
  
   The battery life is underwhelming, especially poor in video playback and web browsing
  
   The audio output is solid but not as great as direct rivals
  
   The benchmark performance is the best we've tested to date, beating out other name-brand competitors
  
   The still camera is one of the best around, rivaling name-brand competition
  
   The video camera does quite well, and supports 4K video recording @30fps
  
   The speaker loudness is good
  
   Good video codec support out of box
  
   Memory card and the SIM card are not hot-swappable

Oppo is a reputed name in International market and this one is their latest flagship device. After Sales support is a real concern as no significant market share till date in India. With very limited number of models and little over priced I can't see much chances of this company to be succeeded in extremely price sensitive Indian market.

  Rating: 8.5/10
  

  so we start with the
  

  Introduction
  

  Oppo is relatively unknown brand in India, However, it cannot be considered as a mere pushover by any means. Its here to stay and stay for good and would give stiff competition to brands such as HTC , Sony and Samsung etc etc.
  

  Points based review:
  

  * Gorgeous 5.5 "" QHD screen with 1440 x 2560px IPS touchscreen and a staggering 534 ppi.
  

  1.It feels great to see and given the real estate it carries it produces stunning colours with high PPI of 534
  
  2. Viewing angles are great and screen can be used wearing gloves .
  
  3. It has a good contrast ratio and is very much comparable to that of one on HTC M8 and others in competition .
  

  4. SunLight legibility is unfortunately only few of the thing that disappoint me in otherwise a fantastic gadget. Screen is very reflective and quite a Finger Print magnet, Screen in sunlight gets difficult to look upon it can be due to the screen protector which company PRE Installs on this device .
  

  5. Gorrila glass 3 is quite good and relieves you with hassle of getting screen protector and it does it works pretty well
  



  * Quad Core 2.5 GHz Krait 400 CPU with the beast of a processor at heart i.e Snapdragon 801 SoC with 3G RAM to keep you engaged with cool multi tasking .
  

  1. This is guys a beast of performance device on AnTuTu it returned with a cool tally of points i.e 43,740 which beats LG G3, HTC M8 and S5 . Man phewww its really did work fine and was pretty lag free with all the multi tasking ON thanks to 3GB RAM on board.
  

  2. Browsing too leaves you a great impression of the gadget and its a great advantage on super or uber cool QHD Screen.
  



  *Android 4.3 operating System with COLOR OS 2
  

  1.Its pretty heavily customised UI but offer good options and have some useful features and less of bloatware.
  

  2. The best part is that you have number of themes to play with including pure jelly bean theme as well .
  

  3. There is exclusive space for Music widget and Camera widget with cool diary function.
  

  4. Lock screen is highly customisable as well with different theme and widgets .
  
  5. Notification area too gives you full icons and controls on the same window which is good as you need not run into settings every other minute.
  

  * 2K recording with 30frames per second and HDR 1080p recording.
  

  1. Recording was pretty good with zoom in facility and did a fantastic job ...sure you won't be         disappointed .
  

  *13 MP camera with Auto Focus and dual LED flash with cool zoom pictures capable of capturing 50MP samples.
  
  Oh yeah !! its was super cool in this field and did produce better pictures compared to few other highly praised flagships. 50 MP stitching is pretty cool and is quite useful . pixels doesn't break on zooming in.
  


  * 3000 MAh battery along with some other features such as NFC , USB OTG , Active Noise cancelation .
  

  1. Gives you good 16 hours of battery backup with heavy or moderate use with Wi-Fi on and brightness set to 75% . Played quite a few games around 40 Minutes and music for half an hour .
  

  **** Greatest and the best innovation is its ultra fast charging charger with blue chip...half an hour on power and bang your phone is fully charged ( well almost) to be used . super useful features given our lifestyle and amount many stay outside . feature I loved most .!!!
  

  * 32 GB of Onboard storage with expandable memory till 128 GB via MSD slot.
  

  Keep everything on board with ample in built memory and to top it off you have a memory card slot expandable unto 128 Gb using Micro SD.
  

  * it has some cool features on screen when powered off such as gesture for music , camera and volume up& Down and gestures to make calls and messaging .
  

  * volume on speaker was pretty loud and crisp , also the voice call quality was pretty good rather I would say Darn good . Good job OPPO
  


  * Fantastic built quality with use of premium material and craftsmen ship shows on this device , its quite light and carries a slim waistline .
  

  * Call reception and network receptions are quite good and features like hotspot and NFC works pretty well and is comparable to major flagships and rather beats many of them.
  
  Continued:
  


  Few Notable dis advantages :
  

  1. Dim navigation buttons at bottom which can be really irritating .
  
  2. Sunlight legibility is below par.( However, viewing angles and clarity is something to boost off)
  
  3. battery life can be little demanding when all the features are on .
  

  thats about it couldn't find any other disadvantages with this .
  

  To be continued ,

  Apart from camera the speakers are also brilliant. Sometimes it lags in running some high quality game but works well with low graphic games.
  
  But the place where it lags is to run 4-G on it you have to go to the store to upgrade it that really sucks.
  
  Apart from all the thing Oppo is doing really and if they improve certain things it will surely emerge as a big company.

  It's awesome mobile...

  2) superb gusters no other branded mobile gaves..
  
  3) speakers output tooo good ... Music sounding very nice...
  
  4)I wann a tell first is this both the cameras are no doubt at all...It's like 13mp back  and 8 mp front but 8 and 5mp given... Very nice cameras...

Anand Thakur,f505d99b927148d98b098df685896d7f,"OPPO R7 Lite (Golden, 16 GB)",MOBEDFMGNEN2V4GC,5,One of the best phone,"Hi all,
  

  I have been using this mobile from last 2 days. I did purchased it from local mobile store and it cost me 18500 including phone, flip cover, selfie stick and also a screen protector.
  
  Now about the mobile, Just one word its ""SEXY"". I have never thought of buying oppo but once i saw it i was in love. Its slim, light weight and easy to hold and operate with one hand. Although I am 6ft tall but i never loved the concept of 5.5"", for those big mobiles you ave to use your both hands to operate it.
  
  Now Start some Pros and Cons
  
  Pros:
  
  1. The best looks within this segment, its killer
  
  2. The best camera, I have tested the camera with samsung galaxy s6 and yes i can easily say its not less than that. It can compete with most of the god camera phones available in the market. Pictures are crisp, sharp and beautiful, both back and front.
  
  3. Super smooth
  
  4. Not even a single lag, easily handled games like asphalt 8 and nova 3. Its beast for gaming you will just love every moment while playing games on this mobile.
  
  5. Fast charging....charges 100% in 1hr and 15 mins.
  
  6. Screen, although its just a HD screen but colour reproduction and viewing angles are excellent
  
  7. Corning gorilla glass 3 protection
  
  Cons:
  
  1. Battery only 2320 mah. If you are noraml user than it can last around 7-8 hrs easily using wifi, 3g, and some calls. For moderate to heavy user you need to carry a charger or extra power bank everytime.
  
  2. Hybrid Slot (you can use it as dual sim or one sim and one sd card).
  
  If you really want to buy that looks sexy and performs awesome, you can always consider this. Nothing better than this at this price range. Its awesome.
